But not all the theories based on this principal, like men becoming more intelligent over and over again during their evolution, are for me easy to follow. It raises questions. I will explain why. Sometimes I get the feeling that the theory, that evolution is based on coincidences, is not only that popular because it describes the evolution of life and mankind in a clear way but because it makes it possible to get rid of a ‘creator’ in any form. In this respect it is an alternative to religion. Sometimes that seems to be the main, or at least a very important, reason why the Evolution Theory has become so huge and undisputable. Including the risk of becoming a believe and religion on its own: <strong><!--[-->coincidence is the new religion<!--]--></strong>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[--><img src="/coincidence%20is%20the%20new%20religion.png" alt="coincidence is the new religion.png"><!--]--></p><p><!--[-->What is my problem with the Evolution Theory, just based on coincidences? So where does it squeeze?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->According to the Evolution Theory the principle of the ‘survival of the fittest’ should lead to better adapted life forms with the result that these life forms each time reach a higher level of evolution: more speed, more brains or more other capabilities. In this respect we want to see ourselves as the end result, for the time being, of this process because we are the ‘homo sapiens’.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->But is this principle indeed the driving force behind such a process, or the only force? If you are well adapted to specific circumstances than you are well adapted: ‘the survival of the good enough’. Than why is there the need or a reward to adapt even more? Only if the adaptation at any moment in time is not good enough anymore or could give a significantly better existence, yes there would be a reason. Why should such a situation appear over and over again during millions of years to keep the evolution going? And what is even more an enigma to me: consequently in the same direction! Let us for instance take a look at giraffes. They are well adapted with their long necks to reach the leaves higher up in the trees, higher than competitive animals are able to reach. That appears to be good enough. I have never heard about these necks becoming even longer and longer because they can’t reach the highest leaves. It is ok the way it is. One giraffe with the longest neck of all apparently does not present the best fit and so dictates the future evolution of giraffes.<!--]--></p><p><!--[--><img src="/extreem%20long%20neck.jpeg" alt="extreem long neck.jpeg" style="height:350px;margin:0 auto;"><!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Let us also look at human beings. Are we more intelligent than the ancient Romans or Greeks? Than say Julius Ceasar or Plato? I have read some of their work and I can assure you that it is an illusion to think that we are more intelligent. So obviously, they fitted well enough and so over the last 2000 years or so no evolution of our intelligence has taken place. But we believe that before that time, this indeed happened based on a randomly occurring variation over a period of a couple of 100.000 to 1.000.000 years, during which Homo Heidelbergensis evolved into Homo Sapiens. But what the trigger was, that led to this development with a focus on a slowly but steadily increasing intelligence over such a long period is unclear to me. Did over and over again a bit more intelligence make the better fit? Why? How? This step-by-step growing intelligence should have happened many times but still random. This seems unlikely, even more if you realize that almost all mutations of DNA are neutral or negative in their effect. Positive mutations are very rare! We do not see this process happening in our days and well you can imagine that other human traits - like looks, strength, dominancy, drive and cunningness - were at least equally as important during those days.

There is a small chance that due to small DNA differences (genetic variation) an interaction can take place between or with little different seeds, eggs, sperm cells etc. – different from the ‘standard’ seeds, eggs, sperm cells - and that this results in an offspring that by coincidence is a little more adapted to specific circumstances and subsequently will have an advantage over the offspring produced by or with the ‘standard’ seeds (and so on) and so has the opportunity to become the new ‘standard’ (natural selection). Or with less words: Survival of the fittest (or maybe better: survival of the best fit) means that organisms, that are better adapted to their environment, are best suited to survive and to successfully reproduce.
