This susceptibility is transferable from generation to generation.",[17,21,22],{},"Therefor this NI implicates a specific evolutionary focus and so a directional evolution, with the capability of defining a species.

Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory.” Darwin admits that “though we do find many links — we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all extinct and existing forms by the finest graduated steps.” He states, “That the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is imperfect to the degree required by our theory, few will be inclined to admit.” He also acknowledges, “He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record, will rightly reject the whole theory.”",[87,215,216],{},"At least part of this absence can be declared by revolutionary evolution, by focused traits, by dormant traits that seize their chance if a mutation of another trait makes it possible for the dormant trait to become active and also on the basis of traits, which basics are already there right from the beginning, waiting for an internal and external fit.
