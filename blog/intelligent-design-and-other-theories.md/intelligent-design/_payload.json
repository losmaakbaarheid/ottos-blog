The overall term for these theories is ‘intelligent design’ (ID). NI agrees that it is unmistakable that in the evolution of life intelligence (in a bit other meaning) plays an important part. But that this intelligence does not include an intelligent somebody or something, but an intelligence incorporated in DNA and in the evolution of life itself. Let us see how the supporters of ID look at evolution, and the roll of intelligence and how NI stands in that. I have used ChatGTP in order to get the main themes of ID and the arguments in favour (core idea, example) and against (criticism).

This mutation can also effect other parts so they can start to function together (so called ‘package deal’). This is initiated by a focused trait that nullify obstructive traits and can make ‘useless’ traits useful, so one mutation can impact more parts in a system simultaneously. Exaptation is in my opinion not a possible explanation for this.

Otherwise the first living cell would have died instantly. That can’t be explained by beneficial mutations gradually building up new functions. The time to do so was just not there at that moment. So the ‘criticism’ can never hold. Besides that I presented a quiet huge number of examples, motivations and articles based on research that contradicts that only beneficial mutations could give these result. The right answer? I don’t know. Obviously DNA was coded right from the start to bring life. How? Maybe there is something like a ‘law of life’ like there is a ‘law of gravity’ and is life one of the basis forces. Possibly our knowledge will grow so much in the future that some explanation will become obvious without the need of ‘coincidences’ and without the need of a ‘creator’.",[17,144,145],{},[30,146,147],{},"5.
