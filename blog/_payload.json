There is a small chance that due to small DNA differences (genetic variation) an interaction can take place between or with little different seeds, eggs, sperm cells etc. – different from the ‘standard’ seeds, eggs, sperm cells - and that this results in an offspring that by coincidence is a little more adapted to specific circumstances and subsequently will have an advantage over the offspring produced by or with the ‘standard’ seeds (and so on) and so has the opportunity to become the new ‘standard’ (natural selection). Or with less words: Survival of the fittest (or maybe better: survival of the best fit) means that organisms, that are better adapted to their environment, are best suited to survive and to successfully reproduce.

Why should such a situation appear over and over again during millions of years to keep the evolution going? And what is even more an enigma to me: consequently in the same direction! Let us for instance take a look at giraffes. They are well adapted with their long necks to reach the leaves higher up in the trees, higher than competitive animals are able to reach.

And this could indeed be qualified as a trigger for evolution that was there constantly for a longer period of time. So getting lighter and lighter over a period of many thousands of years in many small steps can be considered as un understandable evolutionary process, in the combination with the fact that the migration of mankind from the tropics to colder regions also was a process over a longer period of time.

For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’.

This ‘sudden’ change of susceptibility can be a reaction to exterior or interior circumstances (actively, because these circumstances activate certain processes in the bodies of the species) or can be initiated by a coincidental other type of mutation that offers a new inheritable susceptibility for genetic variations that could (in time) give a better fit or another fit (passively) than the existing inheritable susceptibility. A new species (in time), possibly even no longer belonging to the same family of plants or animals, can be the result of this. Existence next to a group of species that did not undergo these changes, is possible or even likely, because the difference in focus becomes so big, that in time there is no decisive competition on an equal level for territory and/or food.

Random mutations are of course there but a bit surprisingly also directional changes. Stasis is frequently associated with the theory of punctuated equilibrium, in which most evolutionary changes are concentrated during the (phylogenetic) branching of lineages in very rapid bursts of speciation. Much longer episodes of relative morphological invariance, or stasis, follow the speciation events. Doesn’t that sound a little bit like revolutionary evolution and even like active susceptibility? Is my NI-theory really that new? In a recent article by Hunt this scientist writes that he has found that directional change during the evolution of a lineage is relatively small (occurring only in 5% of 250 analysed traits). Of those traits that were shown to follow a trend, size was more likely to show gradual changes, whereas shape changes were more random.

Beside that this article gives no real insight in the evolutionary importance of these 5%. Did they concern the same kind (concerning their importance) of traits as those which changed randomly? Or did they concern traits that were more essential for the evolution of these species? As already indicated maybe not more than 1-2% of all traits may be focused traits. So 5% is in that respect even more than to be expected. Besides that, directional processes deliver faster and better results within fewer steps than a process dictated by coincidences.

Of course other traits can play their roll and possibly some more modifications are needed, but it all starts with this switching on of the incorporated basics of the concerning trait. This is nothing special but a process that happens in every newborn. Every living creature starts out as a single cell. This cell splits and these new cells develop into all kind of more specific cells. For instance after fertilization a human cell splits into more than 200 different cell types, like skin cells, liver cells, bone cells, blood cells and so on. Although these cell types look and function differently they contain exactly the same DNA. Chemical processes modify DNA without changing the actual DNA sequence. Genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the development of the cells and which is translated into proteins.

So basically the needed sequence is already there, just the right molecular processes to develop this trait, have to happen. Maybe by coincidence or maybe triggered by internal or external influences. So the DNA of the one cell living creature could already have had the potential to develop new traits and so in this way offer the origine of all kind of new species, that are defined by these new traits.

You could think about a longer DNA, in which these extra length represents this ‘new’ trait. Wrong! For instance the length of the DNA of humans and animals like mouse, dogs and chimpanzees is about the same. And that also applies for the order of genes.

There is a manual and there is some staff with a basic training how to operate the machine. But the machine is extremely complex with an awful lot of buttons, clocks, possible processes and so on. So it takes very much time to get familiar with all the possibilities of the machine and to tune all the processes taking place within the machine.

could compare the evolution of life with an orchestra learning to play a symphony. To reach a level, that an audience will enjoy the concert, and so is willing to pay for it, a lot of conditions have to be fulfilled. First you need the right instruments depending on the orchestration. Violins will always be needed, like cello’s. Other less standard instruments can be added. But the basics of an orchestra is always the same. Then we need musicians to play the instruments. Further we need a composition, a conductor and the time and space to rehearse. The problem is that there is only a very basic composition for only the basic instruments. Not much more than some first notes, the key and the meter are known. So only a few players know at what moment to play which notes. All the other players therefor stay asleep. Another problem is that the musicians are just enthusiastic beginners. The first song only lasts 5 minutes. But everybody, also the not yet demanding audience, is happy with this first rudimentary song and performance. As soon as the harmony is reached, it is put on paper. But after a while, hearing this same song over and over again, the crowd is getting a bit bored and is not willing to pay anymore only for this simple music and mediocre musicians. They want to hear more. So the members of the orchestra don’t earn enough money anymore to survive. By coincidence or because of some actions of the conductor, some sleeping players awake. Maybe because they are also getting hungry. So being awake they try to play along with the melody. In the beginning it really sounds horrible. Luckily some instruments can play some of the notes already put on paper. Nevertheless people start booing. The new players make an extra effort to pick up the melody, the conductor gives instructions, the players rehearse many times and so are getting better and better. Maybe partly also by coincidence a new musician hits a right note and tries to remember it. So slowly but steadily the music starts to sound better and finally a harmony is reached. Again this is put on paper. The audience hears something new and is willing to pay again. The playing members of the orchestra become professionals, so the music sound better and more complex and again everybody happy. But then is starts all over again: a percentage, not all, of the audience is getting bored. So again other musicians are asked to join in. And they do this again, which gives - after mismatches, trying all kind of variations, rehearsing and fine-tuning - a positive outcome. The song is becoming ever more complex, more instruments involved, more variations and also longer. Some people stay with the more simple versions, some go to the more complex versions and also new audiences are willing to listen to the more complex versions of the tune and pay for it. The audience is happy again, but after a while some of them don’t want to hear all these simple and more complex variations of the same tune over and over again. And also there is still a large group of people that is not coming to the concert hall at all. So there is room for another melody, another symphony. And so the whole process starts all over again in order to be able to play two melodies. The players are better prepared and are more experienced but the audience is getting more demanding. They want to hear something else. Not the same orchestration and there are still instruments untouched. The experienced players have to play more complex cords, music in another key and also new instruments are coming in. But the composition is again incomplete. So on a bit higher level the whole process of failing, trying, rehearsing, finding the right harmony, and so on, starts all over again. After a lot of time has passed, because of the higher complexity of the composition, the playing of a second symphony is ready. Everybody happy and because of the better musical quality the people coming to the concert are willing to pay more. Many years later the orchestra is even able to play many symphonies in different keys and meters, in a more simple form and in more complex forms. Not only classical but also modern and even rock. Every performance has its own audience. Some people visit two or even a couple of concerts. There are also people who hate some of the music played. After a while some music gets outdated, people want to hear new things, or existing music but played in another way. This results in a combination of evergreens, new melodies, enhanced melodies and so on. ©2024 oke",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":2290,"children":2291},{},[2292],{"type":21,"value":2293},"I hope you can follow the parallels between this story and the evolution of life and that you can agree.

If you consider the mentioned possible function of the non-coding DNA concerning the altering and innovation of gene functions one could suspect a mutual relationship: more (r)evolution means more non-coding DNA and more non-coding DNA means more (r)evolution. In fact researchers found evidence that the transposons responsible for the growing of the DNA of the marbled lungfish are still active. So again an indication that evolution is not only the result of random mutations. Because mankind has had more evolutionary developments than worm, the already mentioned different length of the DNA between both species, can also explained: not because more new straits had to develop in humans but more evolutionary steps were made. And also the fact that all essential evolutionary changes has resulted in about 23000 protein coding genes in a marbled lungfish, so hardly any more than humans, is an indication that extra, new or changing traits are not coming out of nothing and so lead to an all the time increasing number of genes, the more evolutionary steps have been made.

These other theories are commonly rejected by evolutionists. Sometimes with a clear motivation, but also sometimes just because of a relentless believe in Darwinism as the one and only truth. I am talking for instance about ‘Saltation’. Saltation, or abrupt specification, stands for a sudden and large mutational change from one generation to the next, potentially causing single-step speciation. Speciation, such as by polyploidy in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. There were geneticists of name that supported this evolutionary concept and even Charles Darwin did not deny the possibility of genetic ‘jumps’. This mutation theory of evolution suggests that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. In the 1940s a downfall of saltational views of evolution followed. But more recently these kind evolutionary theories are getting more support again. Goldschmidt (an important scientist in this respect) presented a mechanism involving “rate genes” or “controlling or regulatory genes” that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. Donald Prothero wrote about the importance of a few genes controlling big changes in the organisms. Embryology has shown that if you affect an entire population of developing embryos with a stress (such as a heat shock) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development. Evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson  reported in an article \"Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win. But small-effect mutations still matter a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow. Goldschmidt proposed that mutations occasionally yield individuals within populations that deviate radically from the norm and referred to such individuals as \"hopeful monsters\". If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species. For example, it is clear that dramatic changes in phenotype can occur from few mutations of key developmental genes and phenotypic differences among species often map to relatively few genetic factors.  Evidence of phenotypic saltation has been found in the centipede and some scientists have suggested there is evidence for independent instances of saltational evolution in sphinx moths.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":2940,"children":2941},{},[2942],{"type":15,"tag":365,"props":2943,"children":2944},{},[2945],{"type":15,"tag":43,"props":2946,"children":2947},{},[2948],{"type":21,"value":2949},"If you compare ‘Saltation’ with NI you see resembles and differences.

The few genes or single gene are or is the focused trait(s) and one gene-mutation can cause the described snow-ball-effect.

Reading in scientific articles that this losing of weight happened very rapidly, in an evolutionary context, this ‘losing weight’ could also have been a potential focused trait. And not only that, but even a focused trait because ‘losing weight’ was not blocked by any obstructive trait. But still this process of losing weight took tenth of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years. During this period in different individuals or groups all kinds of other mutations happened (maybe only by coincidence). So the ancestors of birds did split in all kind of subspecies (indeed fossils of different transition forms have been found). But all with the two mentioned (potential) focused traits coded in their DNA (wings and ‘losing weight’). At different moments, but probably not that far apart, in a subspecies the weight had reduced enough to make it possible to get off the ground as soon as in an individual or in a group the potential trait of flying could convert into the trait of flying (wings!). The result of this was that birds appeared in many variations. So this huge number of different birds is not (only) the result of evolutionary processes during the existence of birds but (also) the result of revolutionary processes in the ancestors in the period before birds appeared.

I have also given a possibility how this could lead to a faster and a clear directional evolutionary process (not only based on ‘survival of the fittest’) and even to a revolutionary evolution because of a more or less fundamental change concerning this susceptibility.

So the inevitable result of evolution could be an as big as possible and an as variable as possible population of species. To reach this, all these different species will have to fit in and fill in every niche that our world offers. That asks for specialisation or even for super specialisation. And that implies that all kind of traits together give the optimum fit. This means complexity, see for instance all the mentioned traits you need to become the best and fastest tree climber or to walk upright. While in the beginning of the evolution is was enough just to be able to move a bit. So the inevitable outcome of evolution according to NI are as numerous as possible and as diverse as possible life forms, varying from one cell creatures to very complex creatures fitting is every niche, even the tinny ones, that by the way makes these life forms more and more vulnerable for even small changes.

And that is the second law of thermodynamics. This supposed contradiction is also known as the Schrödinger paradox. This law states that the total entropy (degree of chaos) in a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process, if it is a closed system; it will never decrease. Say you throw a bottle made out of glass on the floor. The result will never by something that makes any sense, but there are billions of possible random divisions of the chippings. The entropy (the chaos) in a system can only decrease if energy is put into it from outside, resulting is a less chaotic situation. If you talk about the bottle, that means gluing it together again. A living creature is less chaotic than the materials needed to make this creature. To make a living creature, these materials have to be organized and combined in a very special and even unique way, which results in a very strong reduction of entropy. Energy and effort have to be brought in to make a living creature from materials. Energy can be derived from the sun and other sources. But where does this needed effort come from? The Evolution Theory points in this respect to ‘coincidences’ but this second law defines that coincidences will lead to a bigger chaos, a higher state of entropy.

Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory.” Darwin admits that “though we do find many links — we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all extinct and existing forms by the finest graduated steps.” He states, “That the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is imperfect to the degree required by our theory, few will be inclined to admit.” He also acknowledges, “He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record, will rightly reject the whole theory.”",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":4764,"children":4765},{},[4766],{"type":21,"value":4767},"At least part of this absence can be declared by revolutionary evolution, by focused traits, by dormant traits that seize their chance if a mutation of another trait makes it possible for the dormant trait to become active and also on the basis of traits, which basics are already there right from the beginning, waiting for an internal and external fit.

I am aware that there are a lot of assumptions, but it is nothing more than an effort to present a possible third way, somewhere between an evolution solely based on coincidences and an evolution dictated and controlled by a godlike creature. That a god caring about individual people does exist, has never been proven nor the Evolution Theory the way we interpret it nowadays. So I am not that far off with my theory. Of course religion has a history of many years and many believers and there are a lot of scientists that have proven or at least made it plausible that some parts of the Evolution Theory are more than just a theory. But anyway I hope you find my points of view interesting, maybe even a bit plausible, or some parts of it, and at least a reason to think it over and form your own opinion about it. And if you can agree with me, that if you don’t believe in god, it does not automatically imply that you are a follower of the Evolution Theory and the other way around that if you don’t believe that the Evolution Theory is the whole story, you must be a religious person, I think we already have something in common. And if I may boost a bit: I think my theory of NI+ExT (or maybe only parts of them) can explain things religion and the Evolution Theory can’t. In that respect I have no urge to include or exclude a system, or even a god, that influences our world, our lives, time and the universe.",{"type":12,"children":4841,"toc":4861},[4842,4847,4851,4856],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":4843,"children":4845},{"id":4844},"final-words",[4846],{"type":21,"value":4838},{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":4848,"children":4849},{},[4850],{"type":21,"value":4839},{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":4852,"children":4853},{},[4854],{"type":21,"value":4855},"If you have your own thoughts about it, if you can follow my thoughts or if you want to criticise my theory, if you think it contains flaws or mistakes or even think it is complete bullshit, please let me know.
