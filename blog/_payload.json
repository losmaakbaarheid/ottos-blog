And this could indeed be qualified as a trigger for evolution that was there constantly for a longer period of time.

In fact recent research has revealed that mutations are not entirely random, so that in this respect the Evolution Theory is not accurate. For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’.

Random mutations are of course there but a bit surprisingly also directional changes. Stasis is frequently associated with the theory of punctuated equilibrium, in which most evolutionary changes are concentrated during the (phylogenetic) branching of lineages in very rapid bursts of speciation. Much longer episodes of relative morphological invariance, or stasis, follow the speciation events. Doesn’t that sound a little bit like revolutionary evolution and even like active susceptibility?

Of those traits that were shown to follow a trend, size was more likely to show gradual changes, whereas shape changes were more random.

Or did they concern traits that were more essential for the evolution of these species? As already indicated maybe not more than 1-2% of all traits may be focused traits. So 5% is in that respect even more than to be expected. Besides that, directional processes deliver faster and better results within fewer steps than a process dictated by coincidences.

Of course other traits can play their roll and possibly some more modifications are needed, but it all starts with this switching on of the incorporated basics of the concerning trait. This is nothing special but a process that happens in every newborn. Every living creature starts out as a single cell. This cell splits and these new cells develop into all kind of more specific cells. For instance after fertilization a human cell splits into more than 200 different cell types, like skin cells, liver cells, bone cells, blood cells and so on. Although these cell types look and function differently they contain exactly the same DNA. Chemical processes modify DNA without changing the actual DNA sequence. Genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the development of the cells and which is translated into proteins.

You could think about a longer DNA, in which these extra length represents this ‘new’ trait. Wrong! For instance the length of the DNA of humans and animals like mouse, dogs and chimpanzees is about the same. And that also applies for the order of genes. When comparing mouse and human genomes, for example, biologists are able to identify a mouse counterpart for at least 99 percent of all human genes. So a gene-similarity among species is the rule.

So it takes very much time to get familiar with all the possibilities of the machine and to tune all the processes taking place within the machine.

could compare the evolution of life with an orchestra learning to play a symphony. To reach a level, that an audience will enjoy the concert, and so is willing to pay for it, a lot of conditions have to be fulfilled. First you need the right instruments depending on the orchestration. Violins will always be needed, like cello’s. Other less standard instruments can be added. But the basis of an orchestra is always the same. Then we need musicians to play the instruments. Further we need a composition, a conductor and the time and space to rehearse. The problem is that there is only a very basic composition for only the basic instruments. Not much more than some first notes, the key and the meter are known. So only a few players know at what moment to play which notes. All the other players therefor stay asleep. Another problem is that the musicians are just enthusiastic beginners. The first song only lasts 5 minutes. But everybody, also the not yet demanding audience, is happy with this first rudimentary song and performance. As soon as the harmony is reached, it is put on paper. But after a while, hearing this same song over and over again, the crowd is getting a bit bored and is not willing to pay anymore only for this simple music and mediocre musicians. They want to hear more. So the members of the orchestra don’t earn enough money anymore to survive. By coincidence or because of some actions of the conductor, some sleeping players awake. Maybe because they are also getting hungry. So being awake they try to play along with the melody. In the beginning it really sounds horrible. Luckily some instruments can play some of the notes already put on paper. Nevertheless people start booing. The new players make an extra effort to pick up the melody, the conductor gives instructions, the players rehearse many times and so are getting better and better. Maybe partly also by coincidence a new musician hits a right note and tries to remember it. So slowly but steadily the music starts to sound better and finally a harmony is reached. Again this is put on paper. The audience hears something new and is willing to pay again. The playing members of the orchestra become professionals, so the music sound better and more complex and again everybody happy. But then is starts all over again: a percentage, not all, of the audience is getting bored. So again other musicians are asked to join in. And they do this again, which gives - after mismatches, trying all kind of variations, rehearsing and fine-tuning - a positive outcome. The song is becoming ever more complex, more instruments involved, more variations and also longer. Some people stay with the more simple versions, some go to the more complex versions and also new audiences are willing to listen to the more complex versions of the tune and pay for it. The audience is happy again, but after a while some of them don’t want to hear all these simple and more complex variations of the same tune over and over again. And also there is still a large group of people that is not coming to the concert hall at all. So there is room for another melody, another symphony. And so the whole process starts all over again in order to be able to play two melodies. The players are better prepared and are more experienced but the audience is getting more demanding. They want to hear something else. Not the same orchestration and there are still instruments untouched. The experienced players have to play more complex cords, music in another key and also new instruments are coming in. But the composition is again incomplete. So on a bit higher level the whole process of failing, trying, rehearsing, finding the right harmony, and so on, starts all over again. After a lot of time has passed, because of the higher complexity of the composition, the playing a second symphony is ready. Everybody happy and because of the better musical quality the people coming to the concert are willing to pay more. Many years later the orchestra is even able to play many symphonies in different keys and meters, in a more simple form and in more complex forms. Not only classical but also modern and even rock. Every performance has its own audience. Some people visit two or even a couple of concerts. There are also people who hate some of the music played. After a while some music gets outdated, people want to hear new things, or existing music but played in another way. This results in a combination of evergreens, new melodies, enhanced melodies and so on. ©2024 oke",{"type":17,"tag":30,"props":2353,"children":2354},{},[2355],{"type":27,"value":2356},"I hope you can follow the parallels between this story and the evolution of life and that you can agree.

If you consider the mentioned possible function of the non-coding DNA concerning the altering and innovation of gene functions one could suspect a mutual relationship: more (r)evolution means more non-coding DNA and more non-coding DNA means more (r)evolution. In fact researchers found evidence that the transposons responsible for the growing of the DNA of the marbled lungfish are still active. So again an indication that evolution is not only the result of random mutations. Because mankind has had more evolutionary developments than worm, the already mentioned different length of the DNA between both species, can also explained: not because more new straits had to develop in humans but more evolutionary steps were made. And also the fact that all essential evolutionary changes has resulted in about 23000 protein coding genes in a marbled lungfish, so hardly any more than humans, is an indication that extra, new or changing traits are not coming out of nothing and so lead to an all the time increasing number of genes, the more evolutionary steps have been made.

A living creature is less chaotic than the materials needed to make this creature. To make a living creature, these materials have to be organized and combined in a very special and even unique way, which results in a very strong reduction of entropy.
