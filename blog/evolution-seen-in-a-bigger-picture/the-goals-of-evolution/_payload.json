What is the use of these processes of evolution, of life itself? Is there any goal or purpose behind it? You could imagine that DNA doesn’t only describe who and what we are, and in addition defines a certain focus in the evolution of life, but even has some kind of evolutionary goal programmed in it, directly or as an inevitable consequence. AI has also a purpose and goal, so why not NI?",[17,32,33],{},"Before going into that, here some answers to the question of the goal of evolution I found on internet:",[17,35,36],{},[37,38,39],"em",{},"This lack of goal is also why evolutionary paths can lead to what we might consider “inefficiencies” or “quirks.” Evolution results in forms and functions that are good enough to survive and reproduce in their environment, but not perfectly designed. In short, evolution leads to a variety of life forms adapted to different niches, but it does so through undirected processes rather than purposeful goals.",[17,41,42],{},"If something has a goal inefficiencies or quirks are not to be expected? Over a period of 100 of millions of years? ‘Goal’ and ‘designed’ are seen as inextricably linked. I don’t subscribe that point of view. Can’t nature have a goal on its own? Why should something with a goal be perfect? I am not speaking about an almighty god. Why is nature not allowed to find its own revolutionary path if it has a goal, or at least a direction?",[17,44,45],{},"One more:",[17,47,48],{},[37,49,50],{},"For instance, that single-celled organisms eventually gave rise to multicellular organisms might appear to exemplify directed movement towards so-called \"higher\" life-forms. But as Gould (1996) and others point out, there is a left-hand wall to complexity; by definition, the simplest possible organism can only become more complex or stay the same. In this sense, evolution is a \"drunkards walk\", wherein certain lineages inevitably attain unexplored novelty in form and function. By the same token, terms like \"reverse evolution\" and \"devolution\" are nonsensical; similar traits and gene sequences may recur at different moments in biological history, but this is still just evolution: change over time.",[17,52,53],{},"So, if I understand it well, the fact that DNA describes life in many forms and with almost numerous traits is a ‘drunkards walk’? The fact that certain molecule sequences produce all the proteins that living creatures need to live is just a ‘change over time’? That mutations happen (in none life threatening regions) of the DNA which can bring, at least based on the ‘survival of the fittest’, thousands of viable and favourable new traits to fill the niches of biospheres is something inevitable, even if there is completely no direction, law or principles incorporated? For instance if mutations wouldn’t lead to the production of new proteins, life on earth would have perished or be limited to one cell species. The way that codons (DNA triplets) are mapped to amino acids seems to be strongly optimised. There is no ‘left-hand-wall’ which could ever give that result.",[17,55,56],{},"A last one:",[17,58,59],{},[37,60,61],{},"Evolution has no purpose; it simply happens. There is no reason to assume that evolution comes with some objective  “improvement”. The only thing that is constantly improving is the adaptedness of individuals to their given environment.

This sounds to me like ‘a car just happens’. The only thing, according to this quote, that is constantly improving, is the adaptability of individuals to their given environment. How could a fish adapting to its environment end up on land? Did the environment change so much that our ‘apelike’ ancestor evolved to homo sapiens? Which changes did this? Apes and men still survive in the same conditions. Why should a process going in an certain direction and so having an inevitable (end)result, need a ‘strategically planned manner’? Some boundaries and some basic principles are good enough. Gravity is based on a law of nature, electromagnetism is based on a law of nature and also the forces within atoms. Together they have shaped the universe, earth and every particle on earth. So does that needed a ‘strategically planned manner’? If you say yes, than you are religious. If you say no to this and yes to a directional evolution, you are inconsequent. If you say that you need ‘strategically planned manners’ to give evolution some direction and, as a result of that, a more or less inevitable outcome, than you should also need those manners to accept that the universe works according to a limited number of general principles that result in an exact predictable outcome. But for some reason that is no issue.",[17,71,72],{},"Suggesting that the evolution of life could have some directions, some boundaries, some principles is, at least that seems so, blasphemy in the world of evolutionary scientists.",[17,74,75],{},[20,76],{"alt":77,"src":78},"in physics.png","/in%20physics.png",[17,80,81],{},"Back to NI: I EXT have given a possibility how Natural Intelligence could work. The evolution according to NI doesn’t works on the basis of a 100% random genetic variation but on the basis that per species, per limited group within a species or even on an individual level, some regions of the DNA are more susceptible (actively or passively) for variations and that this can be inherited so that it can become a part of the generations to come, especially if this concerns a trait that gives a (better) fit. I have also given a possibility how this could lead to a faster and a clear directional evolutionary process (not only based on ‘survival of the fittest’) and even to a revolutionary evolution because of a more or less fundamental change concerning this susceptibility. But, again, is it also possible that evolution can have a goal or even more goals? Maybe ‘goal’ is not the right word and is the outcome of the evolution of life somehow, between certain boundaries, inevitable.",[17,83,84],{},"‘Survival of the fittest’ leads to a better adaptation (by the way: is that not something inevitable?), NI makes that process faster and makes the chance of a successful independent evolution bigger. It could even be the only option to create a new family of species. And if you compare the evolutionary ‘tree’ of both, NI together with ET gives a way faster, better and more complete result than ET on its own will ever be able to achieve. So the inevitable result of evolution could be an as big as possible and an as variable as possible population of species. To reach this, all these different species will have to fit in and fill in every niche that our world offers. That asks for specialisation or even for super specialisation. And that implies that all kind of traits together give the optimum fit. This means complexity, see for instance all the mentioned traits you need to become the best and fastest tree climber or to walk upright. While in the beginning of the evolution is was enough just to be able to move a bit. So the inevitable outcome of evolution according to NI are as numerous as possible and as diverse as possible life forms, varying from one cell creatures to very complex creatures fitting is every niche, even the tinny ones, that by the way makes these life forms more and more vulnerable for even small changes. So the extinction rate could go up because of this, having a reducing effect.",[17,86,87],{},"Humankind has even reached such a complexity that it is capable to live in other niches then her own and survive there (thanks to cloth, fire, heating, cooling, refrigerators etc.).

On the basis of only the Evolution Theory you would expect much more resemblance between species, the sharing of proven favourable habits and traits, same objectives.

There is for instance one species with an extraordinary long neck and there is one species with a long trunk. Opposite to products developed by men, which normally have huge overlaps. You could say that obviously evolution and time did their work, but will time and human intelligence (so not ‘coincidence’!) lead to less competition in time? No, to more competition!

The Excitatus Theory, stating that all basic traits of life were already incorporated in that DNA, makes the weight of this theory even heavier.

The first part is logic, but the second part may ask for some explanation: If nothing can ever (not in the past, not now, not in the future) experience or observe something, nor its effects, than this ‘something’ is nothing. At least there was, is and will never be any evidence that there is or was or will be something. The evolution of life has led to the situation that ever more living creatures experience the world in all its facets, the sun, the stars and so on, and their effects, dating from the past (even the lasting effects of the ‘big bang’) until today.

I don’t think so. There are some remarkable facts about the (r)evolution of life. One is that it contradicts or, better formulated, is supposed to contradict one of the most important laws of nature. And that is the second law of thermodynamics. This supposed contradiction is also known as the Schrödinger paradox. This law states that the total entropy (degree of chaos) in a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process, if it is a closed system; it will never decrease. Say you throw a bottle made out of glass on the floor. The result will never by something that makes any sense, but there are billions of possible random divisions of the chippings. The entropy (the chaos) in a system can only decrease if energy is put into it from outside, resulting is a less chaotic situation. If you talk about the bottle, that means gluing it together again. A living creature is less chaotic than the materials needed to make this creature. To make a living creature, these materials have to be organized and combined in a very special and even unique way, which results in a very strong reduction of entropy. Energy and effort have to be brought in to make a living creature from materials. Energy can be derived from the sun and other sources. But where does this needed effort come from? The Evolution Theory points in this respect to ‘coincidences’ but this second law defines that coincidences will lead to a bigger chaos, a higher state of entropy. So this also indicates that NI, an organising feature, is a necessary part of the evolution of life. And of course this organizing feature is DNA.",[17,141,142],{},"A part of the second law of thermodynamics is also that conditions in systems in contact with each other will tend to become uniform: in that situation a warmer room will get colder and the colder room will become warmer. To avoid both processes (chaos instead of ordered materials in a species; and a lukewarm body in a lukewarm room instead of a warm body in a cold space) a source of energy as well as a source or form of intelligence or instruction are needed.

Well we see that the evolution slowly but surely has increased the complexity of living creatures and their variety, so also slowly but surely the level of organisation, structuring and information increases and so the level of entropy decreases. The means that evolution is not a random process that, ruled by coincidences, leads to ever more complex living creatures. I thinks this well accepted dogma is not correct.

Biology and physics are always considered as two separate sciences, but in the end they could be the two sides of the same coin.",[17,260,261,265],{},[20,262],{"alt":263,"src":264},"laws of physics organize zwart1.png","/laws%20of%20physics%20organize%20zwart1.png",[20,266],{"alt":267,"src":268},"2 sides of coin.png","/2%20sides%20of%20coin.png",{"title":270,"searchDepth":271,"depth":271,"links":272},"",2,[],"md",{},true,"/blog/evolution-seen-in-a-bigger-picture/the-goals-of-evolution",{"title":5,"description":270},"03.blog/04.Evolution seen in a bigger picture/02.The goals of evolution",[280,284,288,375],{"title":281,"path":282,"stem":283},"Home","/","01.index",{"title":285,"path":286,"stem":287},"Intro","/intro","02.intro",{"title":289,"path":290,"stem":291,"children":292},"Blog","/blog","03.blog/00.index",[293,294,298,320,334,349,353,367,371],{"title":289,"path":290,"stem":291},{"title":295,"path":296,"stem":297},"The Limitations Of The Evolution Theory","/blog/the-limitations-of-the-evolution-theory","03.blog/01.The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory",{"title":299,"path":300,"stem":301,"children":302,"page":-1},"Natural Intelligence","/blog/natural-intelligence","03.blog/02.Natural Intelligence/index",[303,304,308,312,316],{"title":299,"path":300,"stem":301},{"title":305,"path":306,"stem":307},"Directional Evolution","/blog/natural-intelligence/directional-evolution","03.blog/02.Natural Intelligence/01.Directional evolution",{"title":309,"path":310,"stem":311},"Revolutionary Evolution","/blog/natural-intelligence/revolutionary-evolution","03.blog/02.Natural Intelligence/02.Revolutionary evolution",{"title":313,"path":314,"stem":315},"Summary Of NI (so far)","/blog/natural-intelligence/summary-of-ni","03.blog/02.Natural Intelligence/03.Summary of NI",{"title":317,"path":318,"stem":319},"Implications Of NI","/blog/natural-intelligence/implications-of-ni","03.blog/02.Natural Intelligence/04.Implications of NI",{"title":321,"path":322,"stem":323,"children":324,"page":-1},"Excitatus Theory","/blog/the-excitatus-theory","03.blog/03.The Excitatus Theory/index",[325,326,330],{"title":321,"path":322,"stem":323},{"title":327,"path":328,"stem":329},"The Origin Of Traits","/blog/the-excitatus-theory/the-origin-of-traits","03.blog/03.The Excitatus Theory/01.The origin of traits",{"title":331,"path":332,"stem":333},"Why are fossils of transition forms rare?","/blog/the-excitatus-theory/why-are-fossils-of-transition-forms-rare","03.blog/03.The Excitatus Theory/02.Why are fossils of transition forms rare",{"title":335,"path":336,"stem":337,"children":338,"page":-1},"Evolution Seen In A Bigger Picture","/blog/evolution-seen-in-a-bigger-picture","03.blog/04.Evolution seen in a bigger picture/index",[339,340,344,345],{"title":335,"path":336,"stem":337},{"title":341,"path":342,"stem":343},"Evolution And The Biosphere","/blog/evolution-seen-in-a-bigger-picture/evolution-and-the-biosphere","03.blog/04.Evolution seen in a bigger picture/01.Evolution and the biosphere",{"title":5,"path":276,"stem":278},{"title":346,"path":347,"stem":348},"The Future Of Evolution","/blog/evolution-seen-in-a-bigger-picture/the-future-of-evolution","03.blog/04.Evolution seen in a bigger picture/03.The future of evolution",{"title":350,"path":351,"stem":352},"Origin Of Species","/blog/origin-of-species","03.blog/05.Origin of species",{"title":354,"path":355,"stem":356,"children":357,"page":-1},"Intelligent Design and other Theories","/blog/intelligent-design-and-other-theories.md","03.blog/06.Intelligent design and other theories.md/index",[358,359,363],{"title":354,"path":355,"stem":356},{"title":360,"path":361,"stem":362},"Intelligent Design","/blog/intelligent-design-and-other-theories.md/intelligent-design","03.blog/06.Intelligent design and other theories.md/01.intelligent design",{"title":364,"path":365,"stem":366},"Other Theories","/blog/intelligent-design-and-other-theories.md/other-theories","03.blog/06.Intelligent design and other theories.md/02.Other theories",{"title":368,"path":369,"stem":370},"Summary","/blog/summary","03.blog/07.Summary",{"title":372,"path":373,"stem":374},"Final words","/blog/final-words","03.blog/08.Final words",{"title":376,"path":377,"stem":378},"About","/about","04.about",1739033626044]
