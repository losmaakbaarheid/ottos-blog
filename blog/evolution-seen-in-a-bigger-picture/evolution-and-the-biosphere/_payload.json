The differences between ancestors and new species are quiet small and both have traits that are (especially om the beginning) closely related; not clearly different traits that would excel in the same or different biospheres. There are many transition forms needed with each time a bit adjusted traits, that characterizes each of these forms, before a significant distance is realized compared to species 1, with which it all begins.

Each branch shows a new or principally changed focused trait. To illustrate this every angle is made 90 degrees. So the angle is way bigger and can go in any direction. The result is a 3D beam structure with beams (species) going in every possible direction. These perpendicular angels are possible due to the fact that the DNA regions that determines the new trait are basically already there and therefor just have to be switched on by coincidence or by a trigger. The consequence of this different way of branching is easy to see this way: the evolution of species according to NI does not only goes much faster but is more principal and also leads to a way better filling of the biosphere by a huge amount of species that are less competing with each other and that are far more complementing each other.",[17,44,45],{},"So what to make out of this? My theory is that the ‘NI-tree’ resembles the first step of the evolution of life or of a principle new type/family of species and the ‘ET-tree’ resembles the following phases of developing new species within one family.
