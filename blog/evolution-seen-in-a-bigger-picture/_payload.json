To reach this, all these different species will have to fit in and fill in every niche that our world offers. That asks for specialisation or even for super specialisation.

And that is the second law of thermodynamics. This supposed contradiction is also known as the Schrödinger paradox. This law states that the total entropy (degree of chaos) in a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process, if it is a closed system; it will never decrease. Say you throw a bottle made out of glass on the floor. The result will never by something that makes any sense, but there are billions of possible random divisions of the chippings. The entropy (the chaos) in a system can only decrease if energy is put into it from outside, resulting is a less chaotic situation. If you talk about the bottle, that means gluing it together again. A living creature is less chaotic than the materials needed to make this creature. To make a living creature, these materials have to be organized and combined in a very special and even unique way, which results in a very strong reduction of entropy. Energy and effort have to be brought in to make a living creature from materials. Energy can be derived from the sun and other sources. But where does this needed effort come from? The Evolution Theory points in this respect to ‘coincidences’ but this second law defines that coincidences will lead to a bigger chaos, a higher state of entropy.
