Yes, this research was done on snails, so it looks reasonable to expect that in respect to mammals the number of genetic changes will at least be as large. Overall, the researchers write, the results suggest that live-bearing evolved gradually through the accumulation of many mutations that arose over a period of 100,000 years. But the precise benefits of live-bearing in these snails remain a mystery: by solving one problem, live-bearing would have certainly created others. “_The extra investment in offspring would have almost certainly placed new demands on the snails’ anatomy, physiology, and immune system.

It is written that ‘giving birth’ evolved independently in several lineages of animals. So it concerns a trait which basics were already present in DNA; maybe even right from the start. So this fact, in combination with ‘giving birth’ being a focused trait, makes the chance of a change from ‘laying eggs’ to ‘giving birth’ many times bigger than if this all has to happen on the basis of traits appearing out of nothing and also being the result of just coincidental mutations. If this trait didn’t kill this individual/group, the trait could be there in vain because the other 49 straits, needed to make it work, were not (yet) present.

The researchers observed in both bats and birds that the shapes of the bones within a species' wing or within a species' leg are correlated. Meaning that within a limb, bones evolve together. However, when looking at the legs and wings, the results were completely different: Bird species showed little to no correlation, whereas bats show strong correlation. This means that, contrary to birds, bats' forelimbs and hindlimbs did not evolve independently. So this suggests a coupled evolution of wing and leg.

Different from how it works with animals which are capable of doing only one of both, but still indeed doing both separately (for instance depending on external circumstances; like water fleas and aphids). There are also animals which combine both ways, for instance by laying eggs and putting them back inside, like the echidna. The female puts the eggs in a pouch to breed them there.

These other theories are commonly rejected by evolutionists. Sometimes with a clear motivation, but also sometimes just because of a relentless believe in Darwinism as the one and only truth. I am talking for instance about ‘Saltation’. Saltation, or abrupt specification, stands for a sudden and large mutational change from one generation to the next, potentially causing single-step speciation. Speciation, such as by polyploidy in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. There were geneticists of name that supported this evolutionary concept and even Charles Darwin did not deny the possibility of genetic ‘jumps’. This mutation theory of evolution suggests that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. In the 1940s a downfall of saltational views of evolution followed. But more recently these kind evolutionary theories are getting more support again. Goldschmidt (an important scientist in this respect) presented a mechanism involving “rate genes” or “controlling or regulatory genes” that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. Donald Prothero wrote about the importance of a few genes controlling big changes in the organisms. Embryology has shown that if you affect an entire population of developing embryos with a stress (such as a heat shock) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development. Evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson  reported in an article \"Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win. But small-effect mutations still matter a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow. Goldschmidt proposed that mutations occasionally yield individuals within populations that deviate radically from the norm and referred to such individuals as \"hopeful monsters\". If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species. For example, it is clear that dramatic changes in phenotype can occur from few mutations of key developmental genes and phenotypic differences among species often map to relatively few genetic factors.  Evidence of phenotypic saltation has been found in the centipede and some scientists have suggested there is evidence for independent instances of saltational evolution in sphinx moths.",[14,236,237],{},[229,238,239],{},[232,240,241],{},"If you compare ‘Saltation’ with NI you see resembles and differences.

The few genes or single gene are or is the focused trait(s) and one gene-mutation can cause the described snow-ball-effect. That stress can cause many of the exposed embryos to change in the same direction points in de direction of an active susceptibility and also a revolutionary evolution.

This is called Exaptation. This means a shift in the function of a trait during evolution. Bird feathers are claimed to be a classic example. Initially they may have evolved for temperature regulation, but later were adapted for flight. When feathers were first used to aid in flight, that was an exaptive use. To be honest: I don’t believe a word of this. There does not exist one species that uses feathers just for cooling. Only birds have feathers. And so if this trait is good enough for the mentioned evolutionary process, than why was that never good enough as an end result and so was always and everywhere a further development into a bird a necessity? This is farfetched and unlikely. The length of the feathers was much longer than of the limbs. If there is a relation, than it is that during the long period that the trait of feathers could not yet be used to fly, because the weight was still too high, luckily this ‘useless’ trait could serve as a temperature regulator.",[14,319,320],{},[17,321],{"alt":322,"src":323,"style":172},"airco dog.png","/airco%20dog.png",[14,325,326],{}," A last example of an evolutionary process, that the Evolution Theory can’t explain and NI can. The fact that some species, like some fish and beetles, loose their eyes when living in the dark. What could be the trade-off for this lost? Because having eye sight in the dark is maybe useless, but why should it make a fish with eye sight in such an environment a lesser fit? One can imagine that a change of a focused trait could also block traits that appear to be important to survive. That will inevitably lead to death unless there are circumstances that this trait is no longer essential, like eye sight in the dark. And so if a new focused trait offers a better or even a best fit in circumstances in which the negative effects of this change are not relevant anymore, the fish will have better opportunities in the dark than its counterparts with no mutation but with eye sight. If this mutation, with the side effect of losing eye sight, has also happened to fishes swimming in less dark water, we will never know that, because for them this new focused trait brings not enough compensation for losing eye sight and so is lethal.",[14,328,329],{},[17,330],{"alt":331,"src":332},"fish without eyes diagram.png","/fish%20without%20eyes%20diagram.png",[14,334,335],{},"Back to the title of this paragraph: Why are fossils of transition forms rare?
