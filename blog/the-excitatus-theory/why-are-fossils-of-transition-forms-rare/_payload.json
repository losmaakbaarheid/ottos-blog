Yes, this research was done on snails, so it looks reasonable to expect that in respect to mammals the number of genetic changes will at least be as large. Overall, the researchers write, the results suggest that live-bearing evolved gradually through the accumulation of many mutations that arose over a period of 100,000 years. But the precise benefits of live-bearing in these snails remain a mystery: by solving one problem, live-bearing would have certainly created others. “_The extra investment in offspring would have almost certainly placed new demands on the snails’ anatomy, physiology, and immune system.

The researchers observed in both bats and birds that the shapes of the bones within a species' wing or within a species' leg are correlated. Meaning that within a limb, bones evolve together. However, when looking at the legs and wings, the results were completely different: Bird species showed little to no correlation, whereas bats show strong correlation.

These other theories are commonly rejected by evolutionists. Sometimes with a clear motivation, but also sometimes just because of a relentless believe in Darwinism as the one and only truth. I am talking for instance about ‘Saltation’. Saltation, or abrupt specification, stands for a sudden and large mutational change from one generation to the next, potentially causing single-step speciation. Speciation, such as by polyploidy in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. There were geneticists of name that supported this evolutionary concept and even Charles Darwin did not deny the possibility of genetic ‘jumps’. This mutation theory of evolution suggests that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. In the 1940s a downfall of saltational views of evolution followed. But more recently these kind evolutionary theories are getting more support again. Goldschmidt (an important scientist in this respect) presented a mechanism involving “rate genes” or “controlling or regulatory genes” that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. Donald Prothero wrote about the importance of a few genes controlling big changes in the organisms. Embryology has shown that if you affect an entire population of developing embryos with a stress (such as a heat shock) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development. Evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson  reported in an article \"Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win. But small-effect mutations still matter a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow. Goldschmidt proposed that mutations occasionally yield individuals within populations that deviate radically from the norm and referred to such individuals as \"hopeful monsters\". If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species. For example, it is clear that dramatic changes in phenotype can occur from few mutations of key developmental genes and phenotypic differences among species often map to relatively few genetic factors.  Evidence of phenotypic saltation has been found in the centipede and some scientists have suggested there is evidence for independent instances of saltational evolution in sphinx moths.",[17,233,234],{},"If you compare ‘Saltation’ with NI you see resembles and differences. Some mentioned examples, like “phenotypic saltation”, “few genes controlling big changes”, “if you affect an entire population (….) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development”, \"Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen” and “If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species” do fit well into NI. The few genes or single gene are or is the focused trait(s) and one gene-mutation can cause the described snow-ball-effect. That stress can cause many of the exposed embryos to change in the same direction points in de direction of an active susceptibility and also a revolutionary evolution. And the sudden appearance of a new species under the right circumstances is of course synonym with reaching an internal and external fit.",[17,236,237],{},"Also this sentence is relevant: But small-effect mutations still matter a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow. I think this is a possibility but I think the fine tuning concerning the small-effect mutations already have taken place (as dormant traits) before the determining few genes or single gene mutate.

And so they (probably) died. So the waiting was for a lower weight. Reading in scientific articles that this losing of weight happened very rapidly, in an evolutionary context, this ‘losing weight’ could also have been a potential focused trait. And not only that, but even a focused trait because ‘losing weight’ was not blocked by any obstructive trait. But still this process of losing weight took tenth of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years. During this period in different individuals or groups all kinds of other mutations happened (maybe only by coincidence). So the ancestors of birds did split in all kind of subspecies (indeed fossils of different transition forms have been found). But all with the two mentioned (potential) focused traits coded in their DNA (wings and ‘losing weight’). At different moments, but probably not that far apart, in a subspecies the weight had reduced enough to make it possible to get off the ground as soon as in an individual or in a group the potential trait of flying could convert into the trait of flying (wings!). The result of this was that birds appeared in many variations. So this huge number of different birds is not (only) the result of evolutionary processes during the existence of birds but (also) the result of revolutionary processes in the ancestors in the period before birds appeared.

To be honest: I don’t believe a word of this. There does not exist one species that uses feathers just for cooling. Only birds have feathers. And so if this trait is good enough for the mentioned evolutionary process, than why was that never good enough as an end result and so was always and everywhere a further development into a bird a necessity? This is farfetched and unlikely. The length of the feathers was much longer than of the limbs. If there is a relation, than it is that during the long period that the trait of feathers could not yet be used to fly, because the weight was still too high, luckily this ‘useless’ trait could serve as a temperature regulator.",[17,290,291],{},[20,292],{"alt":293,"src":294,"style":175},"airco dog.png","/airco%20dog.png",[17,296,297],{},"A last example of an evolutionary process, that the Evolution Theory can’t explain and NI can. The fact that some species, like some fish and beetles, loose their eyes when living in the dark. What could be the trade-off for this lost? Because having eye sight in the dark is maybe useless, but why should it make a fish with eye sight in such an environment a lesser fit? One can imagine that a change of a focused trait could also block traits that appear to be important to survive. That will inevitably lead to death unless there are circumstances that this trait is no longer essential, like eye sight in the dark. And so if a new focused trait offers a better or even a best fit in circumstances in which the negative effects of this change are not relevant anymore, the fish will have better opportunities in the dark than its counterparts with no mutation but with eye sight. If this mutation, with the side effect of losing eye sight, has also happened to fishes swimming in less dark water, we will never know that, because for them this new focused trait brings not enough compensation for losing eye sight and so is lethal.",[17,299,300],{},[20,301],{"alt":302,"src":303},"fish without eyes diagram.png","/fish%20without%20eyes%20diagram.png",[17,305,306],{},"Back to the title of this paragraph: Why are fossils of transition forms rare?
