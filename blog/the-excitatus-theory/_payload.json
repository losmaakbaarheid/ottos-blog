So in the DNA of the one cell species with which the evolution of life began. Ready to evolve and, in a certain phase or phases, waiting to be switched on. Is that a possibility? Yes I think so. A one cell species contains approximately 2 meters of DNA. And this equals at least 3 billion nucleotides. That is 3 x 109. This nucleotides represent the program of DNA. Seeing this huge number it is not unlikely that the basics of a big percentage of all biological possibilities of nature were already in DNA right from the start. Also the life of every animal, plant and human starts with just one cell. By the way: this makes the statement that only 2% of the human DNA is useful (encodes proteins) and 98% useless, extremely questionable. Parts of this 98% may have no use for humans and other species as we know them today but could have had and/or could have in the future an important function by encoding proteins in ancestors, successors, other animals, plants, at other moments in the evolution of life.

The resemblance between the DNA of different species could possibly be not an evidence of an evolutionary process during which one species evolves into another species but of the fact that DNA already from the start of life had many genetic possibilities concerning basic traits incorporated and so because of this start, the DNA of different species have ‘so much’ in common.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":47,"children":48},{},[49],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":50,"children":53},{"alt":51,"src":52},"resemblance no evidence.png","/resemblance%20no%20evidence.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":55,"children":56},{},[57],{"type":20,"value":58},"A whole lot of information is already included in one cell and what information is finally used to become a specific capability or trait, is a process of switching on parts of the DNA in this cell. That determines which proteins are going to be produced, which in their turn has a decisive effect on the traits connected with these parts. Of course other traits can play their roll and possibly some more modifications are needed, but it all starts with this switching on of the incorporated basics of the concerning trait. This is nothing special but a process that happens in every newborn. Every living creature starts out as a single cell. This cell splits and these new cells develop into all kind of more specific cells. For instance after fertilization a human cell splits into more than 200 different cell types, like skin cells, liver cells, bone cells, blood cells and so on. Although these cell types look and function differently they contain exactly the same DNA. Chemical processes modify DNA without changing the actual DNA sequence. Genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the development of the cells and which is translated into proteins. Depending on which genes are active at specific times during the development of a cell, the cell develops into a certain cell type. So in this first cell, with which an individual life starts, the basics of all these organs and body parts have to be already present.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":60,"children":61},{},[62],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":63,"children":66},{"alt":64,"src":65},"cell split embryo.png","/cell%20split%20embryo.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":68,"children":69},{},[70],{"type":20,"value":71},"So one specific DNA sequence can lead to all kind of different body parts with all kinds of different functions which, on top of that, also work together. Knowing this, one could wonder why it should not be possible and even reasonable to extrapolate that to different species. One can also imagine that genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the evolution of life and so are translated into proteins that, at a certain moment in time, create a ‘new’ trait. So basically the needed sequence is already there, just the right molecular processes to develop this trait, have to happen. Maybe by coincidence or maybe triggered by internal or external influences. So the DNA of the one cell living creature could already have had the potential to develop new traits and so in this way offer the origine of all kind of new species, that are defined by these new traits. The blue print of the evolution of life could already have been there right from the start. To get all the different species, this blue print is probably not enough. In combination with internal genetical processes - like changing sequences, adding autonomous transposons and so on - and external circumstances, it is.

Recent research has showed that new traits or ‘switched on genes’ are not the result of a changed DNA sequence. In many species these sequences appear to be very much the same. You could think about a longer DNA, in which these extra length represents this ‘new’ trait. Wrong! For instance the length of the DNA of humans and animals like mouse, dogs and chimpanzees is about the same. And that also applies for the order of genes. When comparing mouse and human genomes, for example, biologists are able to identify a mouse counterpart for at least 99 percent of all human genes. So a gene-similarity among species is the rule.

This is still a subject of intensive research, so a bit tricky subject. Some researchers claim that the difference is made by the different proteins, the coding genes produce. Other claim that these proteins don’t change much but that is about the change of the molecular processes that influence this protein-making by these genes.

Then we talk about the terms ‘epigenetic modifications’, ‘transcription factors’, non-coding DNA-sequences and the duplication of genes. It appears that important traits are more the result of the last three influences since changing the proteins, responsible for these traits, is quiet risky because of the possible large impact. So ‘new’ traits are not the product of changes concerning the DNA-sequence and/or the genes themselves. And there are clear restriction concerning changes of produced proteins.

That the DNA-machine, that can produce all kinds of species, is there right from the beginning including the basic capabilities to produce all kinds of traits. Still improvements are needed to make complex traits. So during evolution this machine is improved bit by bit, maybe just by trying (coincidence). There is a manual and there is some staff with a basic training how to operate the machine. But the machine is extremely complex with an awful lot of buttons, clocks, possible processes and so on. So it takes very much time to get familiar with all the possibilities of the machine and to tune all the processes taking place within the machine. In time it more and more becomes clear what will be the outcome depending on when the ‘on’ buttons are pushed and when the ‘off buttons are pushed. And also in what order to do so. A ‘switched on gene’ leading to a ‘new’ trait, and possibly leading to a new species, is nothing more than a discovery (directed or non-directed) by the operators of the machine (the molecular processes) of the capabilities of the machine, to make again and again something new, that is possibly marketable (new fit or ‘survival of the fittest’).",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":102,"children":103},{},[104],{"type":20,"value":105},"Inside DNA the production of a new trait is like operators of a machine discovering an until recently unknown capacity of this machine - and how to handle that - which is capable to manufacture a new (possibly) marketable product.

In my opinion especially this last finding is (almost) an evidence that my “Excitatus Theory’ (I will present in this chapter) is the right evolutionary theory or at least a theory that deserves attention and should be considered as a theory not less relevant than the Evolution Theory.

This implicates a couple of genes that together define the body plan and the number, identity and pattern of body parts. They are qualified as highly conserved. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes determine their outcome. The protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures.

Small changes in toolbox genes cause significant changes in body structures. A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. So this fact, that a small fraction of genes determines the development of the body of a species, that these genes are present in all animals and that this basic genes are capable to produce an huge variation of body shapes, from snakes to elephants, is in my opinion not an evidence of some common ancestor but of one common ancestor: the one cell species with which it all began (often named LUCA) already carried this toolbox genes.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":196,"children":197},{},[198],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":199,"children":202},{"alt":200,"src":201},"luca1.png","/luca1.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":204,"children":205},{},[206],{"type":20,"value":207},"This is the 4th key point of NI and ExT (the genes, that can produce the proteins needed for all basic traits, were already in their basics present in DNA from the start of life).

And probably the first birds, that could only fly a bit, were still so heavy that they could not get high enough into the air to escape all animals hunting them.

To reach a level, that an audience will enjoy the concert, and so is willing to pay for it, a lot of conditions have to be fulfilled. First you need the right instruments depending on the orchestration. Violins will always be needed, like cello’s. Other less standard instruments can be added. But the basics of an orchestra is always the same. Then we need musicians to play the instruments. Further we need a composition, a conductor and the time and space to rehearse. The problem is that there is only a very basic composition for only the basic instruments. Not much more than some first notes, the key and the meter are known. So only a few players know at what moment to play which notes. All the other players therefor stay asleep. Another problem is that the musicians are just enthusiastic beginners. The first song only lasts 5 minutes. But everybody, also the not yet demanding audience, is happy with this first rudimentary song and performance. As soon as the harmony is reached, it is put on paper. But after a while, hearing this same song over and over again, the crowd is getting a bit bored and is not willing to pay anymore only for this simple music and mediocre musicians. They want to hear more. So the members of the orchestra don’t earn enough money anymore to survive. By coincidence or because of some actions of the conductor, some sleeping players awake. Maybe because they are also getting hungry. So being awake they try to play along with the melody. In the beginning it really sounds horrible. Luckily some instruments can play some of the notes already put on paper. Nevertheless people start booing. The new players make an extra effort to pick up the melody, the conductor gives instructions, the players rehearse many times and so are getting better and better. Maybe partly also by coincidence a new musician hits a right note and tries to remember it. So slowly but steadily the music starts to sound better and finally a harmony is reached. Again this is put on paper. The audience hears something new and is willing to pay again. The playing members of the orchestra become professionals, so the music sound better and more complex and again everybody happy. But then is starts all over again: a percentage, not all, of the audience is getting bored. So again other musicians are asked to join in. And they do this again, which gives - after mismatches, trying all kind of variations, rehearsing and fine-tuning - a positive outcome. The song is becoming ever more complex, more instruments involved, more variations and also longer. Some people stay with the more simple versions, some go to the more complex versions and also new audiences are willing to listen to the more complex versions of the tune and pay for it. The audience is happy again, but after a while some of them don’t want to hear all these simple and more complex variations of the same tune over and over again. And also there is still a large group of people that is not coming to the concert hall at all. So there is room for another melody, another symphony. And so the whole process starts all over again in order to be able to play two melodies. The players are better prepared and are more experienced but the audience is getting more demanding. They want to hear something else. Not the same orchestration and there are still instruments untouched. The experienced players have to play more complex cords, music in another key and also new instruments are coming in. But the composition is again incomplete. So on a bit higher level the whole process of failing, trying, rehearsing, finding the right harmony, and so on, starts all over again. After a lot of time has passed, because of the higher complexity of the composition, the playing of a second symphony is ready. Everybody happy and because of the better musical quality the people coming to the concert are willing to pay more. Many years later the orchestra is even able to play many symphonies in different keys and meters, in a more simple form and in more complex forms. Not only classical but also modern and even rock. Every performance has its own audience. Some people visit two or even a couple of concerts. There are also people who hate some of the music played.

These other theories are commonly rejected by evolutionists. Sometimes with a clear motivation, but also sometimes just because of a relentless believe in Darwinism as the one and only truth. I am talking for instance about ‘Saltation’. Saltation, or abrupt specification, stands for a sudden and large mutational change from one generation to the next, potentially causing single-step speciation. Speciation, such as by polyploidy in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. There were geneticists of name that supported this evolutionary concept and even Charles Darwin did not deny the possibility of genetic ‘jumps’. This mutation theory of evolution suggests that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. In the 1940s a downfall of saltational views of evolution followed. But more recently these kind evolutionary theories are getting more support again. Goldschmidt (an important scientist in this respect) presented a mechanism involving “rate genes” or “controlling or regulatory genes” that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. Donald Prothero wrote about the importance of a few genes controlling big changes in the organisms. Embryology has shown that if you affect an entire population of developing embryos with a stress (such as a heat shock) it can cause many embryos to go through the same new pathway of embryonic development. Evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson  reported in an article \"Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win. But small-effect mutations still matter a lot. They provide essential fine-tuning and sometimes pave the way for explosive evolution to follow. Goldschmidt proposed that mutations occasionally yield individuals within populations that deviate radically from the norm and referred to such individuals as \"hopeful monsters\". If the novel phenotypes of hopeful monsters arise under the right environmental circumstances, they may become fixed, and the population will found a new species. For example, it is clear that dramatic changes in phenotype can occur from few mutations of key developmental genes and phenotypic differences among species often map to relatively few genetic factors.  Evidence of phenotypic saltation has been found in the centipede and some scientists have suggested there is evidence for independent instances of saltational evolution in sphinx moths.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":937,"children":938},{},[939],{"type":14,"tag":928,"props":940,"children":941},{},[942],{"type":14,"tag":266,"props":943,"children":944},{},[945],{"type":20,"value":946},"If you compare ‘Saltation’ with NI you see resembles and differences.

This is called Exaptation. This means a shift in the function of a trait during evolution. Bird feathers are claimed to be a classic example. Initially they may have evolved for temperature regulation, but later were adapted for flight. When feathers were first used to aid in flight, that was an exaptive use. To be honest: I don’t believe a word of this. There does not exist one species that uses feathers just for cooling. Only birds have feathers. And so if this trait is good enough for the mentioned evolutionary process, than why was that never good enough as an end result and so was always and everywhere a further development into a bird a necessity? This is farfetched and unlikely. The length of the feathers was much longer than of the limbs. If there is a relation, than it is that during the long period that the trait of feathers could not yet be used to fly, because the weight was still too high, luckily this ‘useless’ trait could serve as a temperature regulator.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":1067,"children":1068},{},[1069],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":1070,"children":1073},{"alt":1071,"src":1072,"style":183},"airco dog.png","/airco%20dog.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":1075,"children":1076},{},[1077],{"type":20,"value":1078}," A last example of an evolutionary process, that the Evolution Theory can’t explain and NI can. The fact that some species, like some fish and beetles, loose their eyes when living in the dark. What could be the trade-off for this lost? Because having eye sight in the dark is maybe useless, but why should it make a fish with eye sight in such an environment a lesser fit? One can imagine that a change of a focused trait could also block traits that appear to be important to survive. That will inevitably lead to death unless there are circumstances that this trait is no longer essential, like eye sight in the dark. And so if a new focused trait offers a better or even a best fit in circumstances in which the negative effects of this change are not relevant anymore, the fish will have better opportunities in the dark than its counterparts with no mutation but with eye sight. If this mutation, with the side effect of losing eye sight, has also happened to fishes swimming in less dark water, we will never know that, because for them this new focused trait brings not enough compensation for losing eye sight and so is lethal.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":1080,"children":1081},{},[1082],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":1083,"children":1086},{"alt":1084,"src":1085},"fish without eyes diagram.png","/fish%20without%20eyes%20diagram.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":1088,"children":1089},{},[1090],{"type":20,"value":1091},"Back to the title of this paragraph: Why are fossils of transition forms rare?
