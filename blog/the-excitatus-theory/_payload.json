So in the DNA of the one cell species with which the evolution of life began. Ready to evolve and, in a certain phase or phases, waiting to be switched on. Is that a possibility? Yes I think so. A one cell species contains approximately 2 meters of DNA. And this equals at least 3 billion nucleotides. That is 3 x 109. This nucleotides represent the program of DNA. Seeing this huge number it is not unlikely that the basics of a big percentage of all biological possibilities of nature were already in DNA right from the start. Also the life of every animal, plant and human starts with just one cell. By the way: this makes the statement that only 2% of the human DNA is useful (encodes proteins) and 98% useless, extremely questionable. Parts of this 98% may have no use for humans and other species as we know them today but could have had and/or could have in the future an important function by encoding proteins in ancestors, successors, other animals, plants, at other moments in the evolution of life.

The resemblance between the DNA of different species could possibly be not an evidence of an evolutionary process during which one species evolves into another species but of the fact that DNA already from the start of life had many genetic possibilities concerning basic traits incorporated and so because of this start, the DNA of different species have ‘so much’ in common.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":47,"children":48},{},[49],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":50,"children":53},{"alt":51,"src":52},"resemblance no evidence.png","/resemblance%20no%20evidence.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":55,"children":56},{},[57],{"type":20,"value":58},"A whole lot of information is already included in one cell and what information is finally used to become a specific capability or trait, is a process of switching on parts of the DNA in this cell. That determines which proteins are going to be produced, which in their turn has a decisive effect on the traits connected with these parts. Of course other traits can play their roll and possibly some more modifications are needed, but it all starts with this switching on of the incorporated basics of the concerning trait. This is nothing special but a process that happens in every newborn. Every living creature starts out as a single cell. This cell splits and these new cells develop into all kind of more specific cells. For instance after fertilization a human cell splits into more than 200 different cell types, like skin cells, liver cells, bone cells, blood cells and so on. Although these cell types look and function differently they contain exactly the same DNA. Chemical processes modify DNA without changing the actual DNA sequence. Genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the development of the cells and which is translated into proteins. Depending on which genes are active at specific times during the development of a cell, the cell develops into a certain cell type. So in this first cell, with which an individual life starts, the basics of all these organs and body parts have to be already present.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":60,"children":61},{},[62],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":63,"children":66},{"alt":64,"src":65},"cell split embryo.png","/cell%20split%20embryo.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":68,"children":69},{},[70],{"type":20,"value":71},"So one specific DNA sequence can lead to all kind of different body parts with all kinds of different functions which, on top of that, also work together. Knowing this, one could wonder why it should not be possible and even reasonable to extrapolate that to different species. One can also imagine that genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the evolution of life and so are translated into proteins that, at a certain moment in time, create a ‘new’ trait. So basically the needed sequence is already there, just the right molecular processes to develop this trait, have to happen. Maybe by coincidence or maybe triggered by internal or external influences. So the DNA of the one cell living creature could already have had the potential to develop new traits and so in this way offer the origine of all kind of new species, that are defined by these new traits. The blue print of the evolution of life could already have been there right from the start. To get all the different species, this blue print is probably not enough. In combination with internal genetical processes - like changing sequences, adding autonomous transposons and so on - and external circumstances, it is.

Recent research has showed that new traits or ‘switched on genes’ are not the result of a changed DNA sequence. In many species these sequences appear to be very much the same. You could think about a longer DNA, in which these extra length represents this ‘new’ trait. Wrong! For instance the length of the DNA of humans and animals like mouse, dogs and chimpanzees is about the same. And that also applies for the order of genes. When comparing mouse and human genomes, for example, biologists are able to identify a mouse counterpart for at least 99 percent of all human genes. So a gene-similarity among species is the rule.

This is still a subject of intensive research, so a bit tricky subject. Some researchers claim that the difference is made by the different proteins, the coding genes produce. Other claim that these proteins don’t change much but that is about the change of the molecular processes that influence this protein-making by these genes.

Then we talk about the terms ‘epigenetic modifications’, ‘transcription factors’, non-coding DNA-sequences and the duplication of genes. It appears that important traits are more the result of the last three influences since changing the proteins, responsible for these traits, is quiet risky because of the possible large impact. So ‘new’ traits are not the product of changes concerning the DNA-sequence and/or the genes themselves. And there are clear restriction concerning changes of produced proteins.

That the DNA-machine, that can produce all kinds of species, is there right from the beginning including the basic capabilities to produce all kinds of traits. Still improvements are needed to make complex traits. So during evolution this machine is improved bit by bit, maybe just by trying (coincidence). There is a manual and there is some staff with a basic training how to operate the machine. But the machine is extremely complex with an awful lot of buttons, clocks, possible processes and so on. So it takes very much time to get familiar with all the possibilities of the machine and to tune all the processes taking place within the machine. In time it more and more becomes clear what will be the outcome depending on when the ‘on’ buttons are pushed and when the ‘off buttons are pushed. And also in what order to do so. A ‘switched on gene’ leading to a ‘new’ trait, and possibly leading to a new species, is nothing more than a discovery (directed or non-directed) by the operators of the machine (the molecular processes) of the capabilities of the machine, to make again and again something new, that is possibly marketable (new fit or ‘survival of the fittest’).",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":101,"children":102},{},[103],{"type":20,"value":104},"Inside DNA the production of a new trait is like operators of a machine discovering an until recently unknown capacity of this machine - and how to handle that - which is capable to manufacture a new (possibly) marketable product.

During the development of an embryo the DNA does not change at all. And during the evolution of life these changes are often limited to even extremely limited. In my opinion especially this last finding is (almost) an evidence that my “Excitatus Theory’ (I will present in this chapter) is the right evolutionary theory or at least a theory that deserves attention and should be considered as a theory not less relevant than the Evolution Theory.

This implicates a couple of genes that together define the body plan and the number, identity and pattern of body parts. They are qualified as highly conserved. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes determine their outcome. The protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures.

could compare the evolution of life with an orchestra learning to play a symphony. To reach a level, that an audience will enjoy the concert, and so is willing to pay for it, a lot of conditions have to be fulfilled. First you need the right instruments depending on the orchestration. Violins will always be needed, like cello’s. Other less standard instruments can be added. But the basics of an orchestra is always the same. Then we need musicians to play the instruments. Further we need a composition, a conductor and the time and space to rehearse. The problem is that there is only a very basic composition for only the basic instruments. Not much more than some first notes, the key and the meter are known. So only a few players know at what moment to play which notes. All the other players therefor stay asleep. Another problem is that the musicians are just enthusiastic beginners. The first song only lasts 5 minutes. But everybody, also the not yet demanding audience, is happy with this first rudimentary song and performance. As soon as the harmony is reached, it is put on paper. But after a while, hearing this same song over and over again, the crowd is getting a bit bored and is not willing to pay anymore only for this simple music and mediocre musicians. They want to hear more. So the members of the orchestra don’t earn enough money anymore to survive. By coincidence or because of some actions of the conductor, some sleeping players awake. Maybe because they are also getting hungry. So being awake they try to play along with the melody. In the beginning it really sounds horrible. Luckily some instruments can play some of the notes already put on paper. Nevertheless people start booing. The new players make an extra effort to pick up the melody, the conductor gives instructions, the players rehearse many times and so are getting better and better. Maybe partly also by coincidence a new musician hits a right note and tries to remember it. So slowly but steadily the music starts to sound better and finally a harmony is reached. Again this is put on paper. The audience hears something new and is willing to pay again. The playing members of the orchestra become professionals, so the music sound better and more complex and again everybody happy. But then is starts all over again: a percentage, not all, of the audience is getting bored. So again other musicians are asked to join in. And they do this again, which gives - after mismatches, trying all kind of variations, rehearsing and fine-tuning - a positive outcome. The song is becoming ever more complex, more instruments involved, more variations and also longer. Some people stay with the more simple versions, some go to the more complex versions and also new audiences are willing to listen to the more complex versions of the tune and pay for it. The audience is happy again, but after a while some of them don’t want to hear all these simple and more complex variations of the same tune over and over again. And also there is still a large group of people that is not coming to the concert hall at all. So there is room for another melody, another symphony. And so the whole process starts all over again in order to be able to play two melodies. The players are better prepared and are more experienced but the audience is getting more demanding. They want to hear something else. Not the same orchestration and there are still instruments untouched. The experienced players have to play more complex cords, music in another key and also new instruments are coming in. But the composition is again incomplete. So on a bit higher level the whole process of failing, trying, rehearsing, finding the right harmony, and so on, starts all over again. After a lot of time has passed, because of the higher complexity of the composition, the playing of a second symphony is ready. Everybody happy and because of the better musical quality the people coming to the concert are willing to pay more. Many years later the orchestra is even able to play many symphonies in different keys and meters, in a more simple form and in more complex forms. Not only classical but also modern and even rock. Every performance has its own audience. Some people visit two or even a couple of concerts. There are also people who hate some of the music played. After a while some music gets outdated, people want to hear new things, or existing music but played in another way. This results in a combination of evergreens, new melodies, enhanced melodies and so on. ©2024 oke",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":280,"children":281},{},[282],{"type":20,"value":283},"I hope you can follow the parallels between this story and the evolution of life and that you can agree.

Researchers are beginning to appreciate how this noncoding (no proteins producing) DNA can be a genetic resource for cells and a nursery where new genes can evolve.

The limb-like features going more or less back to fins. That needs an awful lot of in time changing (focused) traits during all these processes to make this very complex evolution possible. So maybe the length of the DNA of a species is not so much related to the complexity of this species but to the complexity of its evolution. If you consider the mentioned possible function of the non-coding DNA concerning the altering and innovation of gene functions one could suspect a mutual relationship: more (r)evolution means more non-coding DNA and more non-coding DNA means more (r)evolution. In fact researchers found evidence that the transposons responsible for the growing of the DNA of the marbled lungfish are still active. So again an indication that evolution is not only the result of random mutations. Because mankind has had more evolutionary developments than worm, the already mentioned different length of the DNA between both species, can also explained: not because more new straits had to develop in humans but more evolutionary steps were made. And also the fact that all essential evolutionary changes has resulted in about 23000 protein coding genes in a marbled lungfish, so hardly any more than humans, is an indication that extra, new or changing traits are not coming out of nothing and so lead to an all the time increasing number of genes, the more evolutionary steps have been made.

This transition occurred independently in several lineages of animals. Researchers found that the switch from egg laying to live-bearing is caused by around 50 genetic changes that are scattered around the snail genome. Yes, this research was done on snails, so it looks reasonable to expect that in respect to mammals the number of genetic changes will at least be as large. Overall, the researchers write, the results suggest that live-bearing evolved gradually through the accumulation of many mutations that arose over a period of 100,000 years. But the precise benefits of live-bearing in these snails remain a mystery: by solving one problem, live-bearing would have certainly created others. “_The extra investment in offspring would have almost certainly placed new demands on the snails’ anatomy, physiology, and immune system.

That genetic change does not need a reward like ‘survival of the fittest’. This (potential) change is more or less pushed upon the concerning individuals. And as long as it is not life threatening or a major setback, no reason to make a fuss about it if the potential focused trait becomes a focused trait. So it all began with switching on, by internal or external circumstances, of a relevant gene concerning viviparity resulting in the focused trait of ‘giving birth’. Because mutations, concerning this type of traits, happen more frequently than to be expected on the basis of a random process, an individual or a group of a species was/were born with this focused trait, with some frequence. It is written that ‘giving birth’ evolved independently in several lineages of animals. So it concerns a trait which basics were already present in DNA; maybe even right from the start. So this fact, in combination with ‘giving birth’ being a focused trait, makes the chance of a change from ‘laying eggs’ to ‘giving birth’ many times bigger than if this all has to happen on the basis of traits appearing out of nothing and also being the result of just coincidental mutations. If this trait didn’t kill this individual/group, the trait could be there in vain because the other 49 straits, needed to make it work, were not (yet) present.

This difference leads to changes in the size, shape, characteristics and even presence of certain organs and features. For instance in a chimpanzee the foetus brain and head growth starts at about the same developmental stage as that of humans and grow at a similar rate. But in chimpanzees growth stops soon after birth, whereas in humans brain and head growth continues several years after birth.

By the way: I have no clue if this package ‘of giving birth’ was coded in DNA right from the start or if it (partly) gradually evolved in that way, ruled by certain processes or even by coincidences. But the basic theory is that there is one focused trait which pushes ‘giving birth’, or a significant part of this evolutionary path, upon species and that this focused trait takes other traits along his path by waking them up (by making their already present basics to become active or by activating, so far useless, traits) or by causing a specific, coherent snowball effect of mutations.",{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":706,"children":707},{},[708],{"type":14,"tag":26,"props":709,"children":712},{"alt":710,"src":711},"package deal.png","/package%20deal.png",[],{"type":14,"tag":22,"props":714,"children":715},{},[716],{"type":20,"value":717},"NI makes it easier to accept something like a ‘package deal’ than the Evolution Theory does.
