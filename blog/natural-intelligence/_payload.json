Until now we have seen intelligence as something that belongs to living creatures only. But Artificial Intelligence has shown us that this is not a condition. DNA looks much like a computer program and the last years computer programs have been developed with some kind of incorporated intelligence. So why should the DNA of humans and of other living creatures not also include some sort of intelligence? I have no clue why that should not be possible. You could say that it needs something super natural to add intelligence to DNA but then why does is not need that for programming a type of species? It is one or the other: or both parts of the DNA program were ‘written’ or no parts. And let us not forget that recent studies have shown us that indeed RNA, a molecule which looks to be as important for life as its ‘brother or sister’ DNA, shows some kind of intelligence: our cells contain a protein-directing machine, made of RNA and proteins, that sends newly made proteins to where they’re needed most in a cell. This machine is called the signal recognition particle (SRP) and so knows and decides where newly produced proteins will have the most benefits.

One could imagine that as a whole variations are random but on a species level or even on an individual level one variation is more likely to occur than another, for instance due to a lesser stability or a lesser protection against mutations of the concerning region or regions of their/its DNA/RNA. In fact recent research has revealed that mutations are not entirely random, so that in this respect the Evolution Theory is not accurate. For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’. This susceptibility could be there all the time or could be triggered by specific circumstances.

Of those traits that were shown to follow a trend, size was more likely to show gradual changes, whereas shape changes were more random.

Evolutionists even state that it's highly unlikely that in different species the protein groups would have independently evolved into such similar DNA sequences.

This is a natural process of de-extinction and occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then after some time a different species evolves into an almost identical creature. For example, the Aldabra rail was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Aldabra. It had evolved sometime in the past from the flighted white-throated rail, but became extinct about 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise. About 100,000 years ago, sea levels dropped and the island reappeared, with no fauna. The white-throated rail recolonized the island, but soon evolved into a flightless species physically identical to the extinct species.

A really huge amount of physical changes were needed to go from walking like apes do and our ancestors did, to walking on just two legs. To give an idea here a few of these changes: development of vestibular system, shifting of the point of gravity so we will not fall forward nor backward, change of muscular system, change of bone structure (for instance the pelvis of apes differs completely from that of men), change of nerve system, the hole through which the brain connects to the spinal cord migrated from the back of the skull to the bottom, the spinal column went from essentially horizontal to vertical and the curves that make our spine S-shaped were needed to keep our forward-weighted head and trunk balanced over our pelvis and legs.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":1739,"children":1740},{},[1741],{"type":15,"tag":31,"props":1742,"children":1745},{"alt":1743,"src":1744},"skeleton ape and man.png","/skeleton%20ape%20and%20man.png",[],{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":1747,"children":1748},{},[1749],{"type":21,"value":1750},"Did this all happened just by coincidence?

And they wrote that their study revealed that the genes driving the skeletal changes were under strong natural selection. In other words: the transition to bipedalism should have offered early humans a clear evolutionary advantage.
