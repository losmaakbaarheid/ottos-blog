Until now we have seen intelligence as something that belongs to living creatures only. But Artificial Intelligence has shown us that this is not a condition. DNA looks much like a computer program and the last years computer programs have been developed with some kind of incorporated intelligence. So why should the DNA of humans and of other living creatures not also include some sort of intelligence? I have no clue why that should not be possible. You could say that it needs something super natural to add intelligence to DNA but then why does is not need that for programming a type of species? It is one or the other: or both parts of the DNA program were ‘written’ or no parts. And let us not forget that recent studies have shown us that indeed RNA, a molecule which looks to be as important for life as its ‘brother or sister’ DNA, shows some kind of intelligence: our cells contain a protein-directing machine, made of RNA and proteins, that sends newly made proteins to where they’re needed most in a cell. This machine is called the signal recognition particle (SRP) and so knows and decides where newly produced proteins will have the most benefits.

In fact recent research has revealed that mutations are not entirely random, so that in this respect the Evolution Theory is not accurate. For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’.

That is the general opinion. If in our DNA it is programmed that a growing human intelligence is our focus of evolution, then what could trigger this program to be activated, if we are talking about an active susceptibility? A shortage of food could be such an event or of some specific nutrients. Or, maybe even more likely, a longer period of anxiety. Obviously these situations are life threatening and can be caused by not fitting properly anymore due to developments in the outside world. The shortage of food causes a lack of certain nutrients in our body that could give a signal to the region in our DNA/RNA that can initiate a ‘sudden’ change in our DNA, and to be more specific the regions that define our human intelligence. Anxiety produces specific hormones that could do the same. What a cell becomes, is determined by what molecular machines—RNAs and proteins—are operating in that cell. And those RNAs and proteins that are present in a cell are determined by transcription factors that switch genes on and off. So indeed RNA and proteins can switch genes on and off and so can change a cell and these cells in their turn can define the species. And also mutations in the RNA can result to new proteins and lead to fundamental changes in living cells.

Of course 2000 years is an in evolutionary context very short period, so if you look at it from the viewpoint of passive susceptibility that is not surprising.

Yes, indeed, people that decent from those two ethnic groups. Just a coincidence? One should realize that these people survived those bad times, where more often threatened populations are bound to disappear or to be subdued.

Like running, smelling, seeing, digesting, breathing, growing hair, aggression, feeling fear, sexual drift and so on. Estimates indicate that humans have thousands and thousands of traits.
