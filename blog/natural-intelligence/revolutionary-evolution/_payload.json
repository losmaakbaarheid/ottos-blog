So no principle difference, like between men and apes, which don’t compete in the way they ‘haunt’ and the food they eat (at least partly, apes rarely eat meat for instance).

This susceptibility is basically a more than random chance on an inheritable genetic variation. Not only of this variation itself but also of the bigger than random chance that this variation will happen again. And this in its turn is the result of conditions in or around the regions of the DNA that determine the traits that evolve in this way. A change concerning this inheritable non-random genetic variation(s) may lead to a fundamental change that has an effect on the Natural Intelligence. Which implies a change effecting its direction and/or strength, its sensitivity and/or of the circumstances that can activate NI (if talking about active susceptibility). This genetic change from one focused trait to another focused trait or of a trait changing in its way of evolving or from say 20 focused traits to 21 focused traits, can (in time) have way more impacts and consequences than the slow step by step partly(!) different evolutions of two groups of the same species that have become isolated from each other.",[17,104,105],{},"The changes concerning the genetic focus of NI doesn’t by definition lead to a better fit but to the potency of another fit. That the situation after the change towards a new, an extra or a fundamentally adjusted inheritable non-random chance for specific mutations also gives a fit is of course a condition. All other changes concerning the NI will have no viability and will sooner or later lead to death and extinction of the concerning new evolutionary branch. The change of the NI may be a process of small steps following each other but more likely is a change with an invisible but on a genetic level more abrupt impact. This in accordance with recent findings that established which effects DNA and RNA can have on the production of a different and new type of protein resulting in their turn into different cellular processes and so in the end to a possible new species. Probably the speed of change is also dependent on the complexity of a trait. If this trait is determined by a large number of genes (alleles) or by a combination of traits one can expect that a step-by-step process is the only way to reach a noticeable effect. So it will take many years to reach that situation but still in evolutionary perspective quiet abrupt.",[17,107,108],{},"It is even imaginable that a new/changed focused trait will only show its evolutionary effects after a long period of time, for example millions of years, because other focused or non-focused traits will hinder the species to make use of this trait. If these other trait(s) evolve(s) in such a way, that this hindrance diminishes or even disappears in time, the new trait can start to flourish and so give a boost to the evolution of this species (survival of an internal fit). Another possibility is that the concerning focused trait itself evolves in such a way that it can overcome this hinderance.",[17,110,111],{},"So how could this work?

Having proper gene activation, regulatory mechanisms, developmental signals, and functional pathways are all essential. A trait can remain at the molecular or biochemical phenotype stage without developing into an observable physical or behavioural trait. And even if all conditions are met, still traits can be suppressed through for instance genetic dominance, epistatic interactions, epigenetic regulation and environmental influences. In the last situation well known qualifications are dormant and hidden traits. So hidden traits are an integral part of genetics, representing the potential for phenotypic variation that may not be immediately apparent.

Not on a molecular or chemical level but on a physical level. One can imagine that due to a higher susceptibility one mutation happens with a more than random frequence: the focused trait. But the situation could be there that every time this mutation happens, it will result in a combination of traits that is not viable. ‘No survival of an internal fit’. For instance walking upright (as focused trait) without the right balance. So this situation, appearing after relatively short intervals again and again due to the same mutation, leads to a species tumbling over after every step. Not really a favourable result. Or when a situation of balance is reached but most of the food, this species digest, grows on ground level. So no ‘survival of the fittest’. Only if a trait, that leads to a good balance standing upright (internal fit), is present and only if the right kind of food also grows on trees (external fit), the potential focused trait of walking upright, will not any longer lead to death and so the focused trait mutation finally lead to a new species showing itself in a new phenotype: the upright walking creature.",[17,131,132],{},[20,133],{"alt":134,"src":135,"style":66},"olifant overeind.png","/olifant%20overeind.png",[17,137,138],{},"Till that moment the (new) focused trait of walking upright, is only an imaginary or potential focused trait ‘hanging in the air’ because of its ‘regular’ appearance due to a more than random mutation, that can imply this trait.

Going through this door leads to a new genotype and a new phenotype (in time). Further on we will see that this process happened during the evolution of birds. I call this a ‘potential focused trait’. The focused or non-focused trait that blocks the potential focused trait to become real, I call an ‘obstructive trait’.

For instance we have the genetic code for hibernation (or to be more precise ‘torpor’). But because of physical limitations we will probably not wake up anymore.",[17,151,152],{},"Ok back to the evolution of the ancestors of humans and apes. In the period the split took place, a variation or variations happened in the region of the DNA/RNA that defined our Natural Intelligence. It changed from a focus on the capability of climbing into trees better and faster than competing animals to a steady focus on human intelligence. The group which DNA region(s), defining their Natural Intelligence, was not affected, continued their evolution as apes and as animals being even more capable of, for instance, climbing trees (before splitting again into different types of apes). And, as already said, the group, which concerning DNA/RNA region(s) was effected, changed their evolutionary focus into the direction of an increasing (human) intelligence.",[17,154,155],{},[20,156],{"alt":157,"src":158},"grafiek mens aap neanderthaler.png","/grafiek%20mens%20aap%20neanderthaler.png",[17,160,161],{},"Of course the following processes would have been slow with small steps that only happened when and if their different NI was triggered/active and if there were no molecular, chemical or physical obstructions.

This always concerned a group of animals/humans and the following evolution was always in the direction controlled by their (now) different Natural Intelligences. So the effects of this change only became evident after a longer period of time (but still many times faster than possible on the basis of random mutations and ‘survival of the fittest’).",[17,163,164],{},"So a ‘sudden’ change of the speed, susceptibility and/or direction of the NI can be the start of a new species with a far more genetical distance from its ancestors if you compare it with the developing difference between species following their own evolutionary path after being isolated from each other.

If the circumstances are there that also this other trait can present over and over again a good fit and a group or even a few individuals are born with this inheritable susceptibility, it implies a possible viability and a directional evolution based on this mutation - and the susceptibility and the trait it concerns - resulting in a new focus that can imply the origin of a new species. As long as the new fit and the existing fit are not competing too much with each other, the existing and new species can start to live alongside each other. The chance that this is a possibility, is way bigger compared with the arising of a new species due to evolution because the, for instance, way of hunting, type of food and so on will become much faster decisively different.

Living creatures which did not undergo the positive mutation or creatures that in this new less demanding circumstances (say an abundancy of food) have a negative mutation, will also be able to survive. Is there any prove of this? Well maybe and it concerns us. As already mentioned recent research indicate that the last 3000 years the brains of humans shrunk a bit, even since medieval times.

Their, and our, ancestors, already must have possessed a number of these needed traits in their genotype and partly even in their phenotype in order to climb trees. That should also mean that our ancestors already had some of the traits that contribute to the human intelligence. And that would also explain why chimpanzees are among the most intelligent species and why mankind within limits is still capable of climbing trees. Our common ancestors already had some of the traits programmed in their DNA, needed for human intelligence (and needed to climb trees). And parts of those regions were triggered respectively became more vulnerable for mutations and so became the focus at the ‘moment’ the human species started its evolution beside or opposite to the evolution of chimpanzees and other primates.

In my opinion elementary traits like flying, laying eggs and breathing under water will never disappear completely but are only switched off and the concerning sequence/genes will stay dormant in the DNA. A possible clear example of this is the loss of the tail by our ancestors about 25 million years ago. There was no reason for this event but ‘suddenly’ it disappeared. Some scientists say this was due to the fact that our ancestors did not need tails anymore, so evolution did its job. But I can’t follow this line of thought. Having a tail could hardly be such a burden that the law of ‘the survival of the fittest’ could come in. And theoretical we can grow a tail because the code to do so is still in our genes. Every human embryo develops during the 5th to 6th week of intrauterine life a tail with 10–12 vertebrae. By 8 weeks this human tail disappears again.
