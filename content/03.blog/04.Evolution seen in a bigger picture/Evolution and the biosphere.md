# Evolution And The Biosphere

Time to look at the bigger picture. The evolution according to the Evolution Theory looks in my opinion more or less like a umbellifer. New branches are positioned under a small angle to their ancestor branches. Below a photo in 3D and schematic picture of this in 2D.

This results into ‘flowers’ (symbol for species in general; not limited to flowers) forming more or less an umbrella like screen, expanding in time, in relatively close proximity of each other. A lot of the space around the spreading stem stays empty or is only partly filled. Every new species grows in time very slowly away from his or her ancestor, leaving a long trail of transition forms or even of ‘missing links’. The differences between ancestors and new species are quiet small and both have traits that are (especially om the beginning) closely related; not clearly different traits that would excel in the same or different biospheres. There are many transition forms needed with each time a bit adjusted traits, that characterizes each of these forms, before a significant distance is realized compared to species 1, with which it all begins. And so before you can really speak of a new species characterized by a different and new trait. An extremely time consuming process.

When you compare this with a schematic picture of NI (especially with evolutionary revolution) you get a very different result: see the picture below. Each branch shows a new or principally changed focused trait. To illustrate this every angle is made 90 degrees. So the angle is way bigger and can go in any direction. The result is a 3D beam structure with beams (species) going in every possible direction. These perpendicular angels are possible due to the fact that the DNA regions that determines the new trait are basically already there and therefor just have to be switched on by coincidence or by a trigger. The consequence of this different way of branching is easy to see this way: the evolution of species according to NI does not only goes much faster but is more principal and also leads to a way better filling of the biosphere by a huge amount of species that are less competing with each other and that are far more complementing each other.

So what to make out of this? My theory is that the ‘NI-tree’ resembles the first step of the evolution of life or of a principle new type/family of species and the ‘ET-tree’ resembles the following phases of developing new species within one family. So most branches in the NI-tree end eventually in a branch of the ET-type. This combination will give by the far best filling of all biospheres. So indeed a mix of the three models that have become standard in attempts to understand the nature of evolutionary divergence in fossil lineages: directional change, unbiased random walk, and stasis.

Revolutionary evolution followed by evolution (due to random and/or directional mutations) leads to an optimum filling of all biospheres.

The specification of a new species according to the Evolution Theory will, as already said, produce many transition forms; NI will produce only a limited number. Until today not many fossils of transition forms have been found. And as already mentioned many times a discussion is going on if a fossil is indeed a transition form or only family. So again an indication that NI combined with ET gives a better description of the evolution of life than the Evolution Theory on its own. Earlier I showed my surprise that, if you read about the evolution of cheetahs, you will find stories about fossils of its ancestors concerning the evolution of theirs sculls but not about the evolution of their physical development influencing their running speed. Now that becomes easier to understand. Running speed is a focused trait so less transition forms and brain volume is not a focused trait concerning cheetahs so more transition forms. 

There are clear examples of a sudden appearance of a new family of species during the history of evolution. Represented by a 90 degrees angel in the picture above. I will present a few of them.

Mammal ancestors became warm-blooded in burst of Late Triassic evolution (source: James Ashworth, First published 20 July 2022). This jump in the body temperature of mammals happened over 200 million years ago. A new study, published in Nature, suggests that ancestors of mammals known as mammaliamorphs abruptly went from being cold-blooded ectotherms to warm-blooded endotherms, rather than experiencing an extended period of change. This extremely fast burst of evolution would have rapidly redefined how these animals lived, transforming our ancestors into more active creatures that lived a wide range of lifestyles. Dr Romain David, a researcher who co-led the study, says “*We found that the body temperatures of non-mammaliamorph synapsids were around 24-29⁰C, similar to extant lizards, but jumped by 5-9⁰C in mammaliamorphs around 233 million years ago, during the Late Triassic*”.

Control of body temperature is also associated with greater control over development, and around the same time as endothermy is estimated to have evolved, mammaliamorphs also started to develop larger brains and more complex nervous systems. So potential focused traits seizing this opportunity to become focused traits. The origin of mammalian endothermy is one of the great unsolved mysteries of palaeontology. Many different approaches have been used to try to predict when it first evolved, but they have often given vague or conflicting results. So, yes, switching on a gene or genes that already was/were present in DNA could be an explanation: no outside circumstances but internal circumstances and an example of revolutionary evolution. Maybe first latent present as a potential focused trait waiting for the right internal conditions to really become a focused trait.

Another example of an abrupt evolutionary development was the first appearance of mammals. Robert Carroll, a palaeontologist at McGill University, argues in *Trends in Ecology and Evolution* that “*The extreme speed of anatomical change and adaptive radiation during this brief time period requires explanations that go beyond those proposed for the evolution of species within the modern biota*.” Further on it is stated that the (micro)evolution does not provide a satisfactory explanation for this extraordinary burst of novelty and concludes that the major evolutionary transitions in animal evolution still remain to be causally explained”. Some paragraphs back I already wrote that complex evolutionary transitions are impossible to explain on the basis of ‘survival of the fittest’ and ‘random mutations’. Switching on genes, that already were (for a long time) present in DNA can be an explanation. In combination with new focused traits and maybe also a ‘package deal’.

The evolution of birds and the presence of the DNA-region concerning feathers long before the first birds appeared on the face of the earth, have already been discussed. But there are more interesting things to tell about the evolution of birds. First I will present some information I found in articles like “*Mass extinction 66 million years ago triggered rapid evolution of bird genomes*”.

![art mass extiction birds.png](/art%20mass%20extiction%20birds.png)

Shortly after an asteroid slammed into Earth, 66 million years ago, the evolutionary story for the early ancestors of birds began. An University of Michigan study has identified important changes in birds’ genomes sparked by the mass extinction. The researchers found that the mass extinction event sparked shifts in the nucleotide composition. They also found that these shifts seem to be connected to the way birds develop as babies, their adult size and their metabolism. Within approximately 3 million to 5 million years of the mass extinction, surviving bird lineages tended to develop smaller body sizes. So changes in DNA composition were associated with the mentioned mass extinction. The study emphasizes that the extinction events can actually influence organismal biology by altering important aspects of how genomes evolve.

If I understand this well, one could read that an external trigger (the slamming of the asteroid into the earth) changed the focused traits of the concerning species so birds could survive this catastrophe and start their evolution. And body weight played a decisive role in this evolution. And also is stated that this happened in more than one lineage at the same moment.
