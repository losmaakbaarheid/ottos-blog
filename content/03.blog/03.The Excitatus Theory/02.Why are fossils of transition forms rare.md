# Why are fossils of transition forms rare?

Switching on and off of genes offers the opportunity to explain evolutionary processes the Evolution Theory can’t. At least in my opinion. I already mentioned the transition from quadrupedalism to bipedalism as a result of many mutations, where each individual mutation on its own would have offered zero better fit, if not a worse fit. Meaning that this process would have stopped as soon as it began if ‘survival of the fittest’ was the only engine of evolution.

Another example is the transition from ‘laying eggs’ to ‘giving birth’’  (viviparity). This transition occurred independently in several lineages of animals. Researchers found that the switch from egg laying to live-bearing is caused by around 50 genetic changes that are scattered around the snail genome. Yes, this research was done on snails, so it looks reasonable to expect that in respect to mammals the number of genetic changes will at least be as large. Overall, the researchers write, the results suggest that live-bearing evolved gradually through the accumulation of many mutations that arose over a period of 100,000 years. But the precise benefits of live-bearing in these snails remain a mystery: by solving one problem, live-bearing would have certainly created others. “\_The extra investment in offspring would have almost certainly placed new demands on the snails’ anatomy, physiology, and immune system. It’s likely that many of the genomic regions we identified are involved in responding to these types of challenges\_.”
