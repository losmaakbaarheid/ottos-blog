# Why are fossils of transition forms rare?

Switching on and off of genes offers the opportunity to explain evolutionary processes the Evolution Theory can’t. At least in my opinion. I already mentioned the transition from quadrupedalism to bipedalism as a result of many mutations, where each individual mutation on its own would have offered zero better fit, if not a worse fit. Meaning that this process would have stopped as soon as it began if ‘survival of the fittest’ was the only engine of evolution.

Another example is the transition from ‘laying eggs’ to ‘giving birth’’  (viviparity). This transition occurred independently in several lineages of animals. Researchers found that the switch from egg laying to live-bearing is caused by around 50 genetic changes that are scattered around the snail genome. Yes, this research was done on snails, so it looks reasonable to expect that in respect to mammals the number of genetic changes will at least be as large. Overall, the researchers write, the results suggest that live-bearing evolved gradually through the accumulation of many mutations that arose over a period of 100,000 years. But the precise benefits of live-bearing in these snails remain a mystery: by solving one problem, live-bearing would have certainly created others. “\_The extra investment in offspring would have almost certainly placed new demands on the snails’ anatomy, physiology, and immune system. It’s likely that many of the genomic regions we identified are involved in responding to these types of challenges\_.”

So a mystery why this process started and why it continued. What where the benefits of the end result and of every of the 50 individual mutations in between? The ‘survival of the fittest’ has no answer. And NI and ExT? Yes, I think so. Or at least a possible explanation.

![man out of egg.png](/man%20out%20of%20egg.png)

First: a change of one or more (potential) focused traits could have started the process. That genetic change does not need a reward like ‘survival of the fittest’. This (potential) change is more or less pushed upon the concerning individuals. And as long as it is not life threatening or a major setback, no reason to make a fuss about it if the potential focused trait becomes a focused trait. So it all began with switching on, by internal or external circumstances, of a relevant gene concerning viviparity resulting in the focused trait of ‘giving birth’. Because mutations, concerning this type of traits, happen more frequently than to be expected on the basis of a random process, an individual or a group of a species was/were born with this focused trait, with some frequence. It is written that ‘giving birth’ evolved independently in several lineages of animals. So it concerns a trait which basics were already present in DNA; maybe even right from the start. So this fact, in combination with ‘giving birth’ being a focused trait, makes the chance of a change from ‘laying eggs’ to ‘giving birth’ many times bigger than if this all has to happen on the basis of traits appearing out of nothing and also being the result of just coincidental mutations. If this trait didn’t kill this individual/group, the trait could be there in vain because the other 49 straits, needed to make it work, were not (yet) present. So it/they could carry for instance the veins needed for giving birth, but with no use (and no harm).

A fundamental evolutionary change or innovation is on the basis of the existence of potential focused traits many times more likely to happen (and so logical) than on the basis of the evolvement of the needed new traits out of random mutations with no prior genetical basics concerning these traits.

![fundamental evolutionary change.png](/fundamental%20evolutionary%20change.png)

It is imaginable, because the concerning mutations are happening again and again during evolution in more than one lineage, that by coincidence some of the species that got the focused trait of ‘giving birth’, also had by coincidence some of the other 49 traits like the mentioned veins. But all? Not very likely. So what could make it more likely that the focused trait of ‘giving birth’, when it appeared in an individual or in a group, was supported by the presence of all the other needed traits to make it together work? There are a few possibilities:

1. The mutation in the DNA-code, that led to the switching on of the focused trait ‘giving birth’ caused a ‘snowball effect,’ so initiating more mutations concerning the other 49 relevant traits;
2. The other traits where already there, but in a dormant state, (more or less) awakened by the focused trait;
3. In the development of an embryo the ‘players’ there, which are responsible for switching off and on of genes at the right moment and location to let the embryo develop in the right direction, changed their behaviour when they ‘discovered’ the new trait of giving birth;
4. A combination of 2 or 3 of these possibilities.

I will focus on the possibilities 1. and 2. or a combination of both, but I certainly don’t want to exclude possibility 3. In evolutionary developmental biology that process is called heterochrony and concerns any genetically controlled difference in the timing, rate, or duration of a developmental process in an organism compared to its ancestors or other organisms. This difference leads to changes in the size, shape, characteristics and even presence of certain organs and features. For instance in a chimpanzee the foetus brain and head growth starts at about the same developmental stage as that of humans and grow at a similar rate. But in chimpanzees growth stops soon after birth, whereas in humans brain and head growth continues several years after birth. Humans have, compared with chimpanzees, some 30 different body developments that are being delayed or slowed down, resulting in features such as a large head, a flat face, and relatively short arms. This implicates also a prolonged childhood and retarded maturity.

Which one of the above named evolutionary processes is the right on, if any, I don’t know. But a process like this or similar to this, must have happened, because a process of 50 independently occurring mutations, all by coincidence, leading again all just by coincidence to ‘survival of the fittest’ and the complex trait of ‘giving birth’, is not only unlikely but completely impossible (in my opinion).

![complex evolutionary transitions zwart1.png](/complex%20evolutionary%20transitions%20zwart1.png)

You may wonder if ‘giving birth’ as an evolutionary ‘package deal’ is not also something unlikely. But this is not something genetically unprecedented. Because life from the very start was already some kind of ‘package deal’ considering all the traits the first living cell needed to stay alive and to reproduce. By the way: I have no clue if this package ‘of giving birth’ was coded in DNA right from the start or if it (partly) gradually evolved in that way, ruled by certain processes or even by coincidences. But the basic theory is that there is one focused trait which pushes ‘giving birth’, or a significant part of this evolutionary path, upon species and that this focused trait takes other traits along his path by waking them up (by making their already present basics to become active or by activating, so far useless, traits) or by causing a specific, coherent snowball effect of mutations.

![package deal.png](/package%20deal.png)

NI makes it easier to accept something like a ‘package deal’ than the Evolution Theory does. Meaning, traits that somehow more or less purposely work together to reach a certain effect, like ‘life’, like ‘giving birth’ and like ‘walking upright’ (in genetics complex traits are traits that are phenotypes that are controlled by two or more genes; here with complex traits I mean an essential trait that can only work on the basis of a combination of more than a few, coordinated sub traits. So there is an overlap but it is not the same).

How could possibility1. work?

I introduced the term ‘package deal’ as a cooperation between separate traits to make together a complex trait work. In the science of genetics there is already a term for this and that is Phenotypic integration. Phenotypic integration provides an explanation as to how traits are integrated, organized, and made into a functional whole. Indeed an internal fit after reaching harmony. Integration is also associated with functional modules. According to Phenotypic integration it is important for the concerning traits do evolve together (by the way: to my opinion mutations that influence each other is not something random).

If all features of an organism are completely integrated, the parts will be prevented from evolving independent adaptations (‘harmony’ is out of reach). Therefor these ‘packages’ are supposed to influence the traits within the same package but not the traits in other packages. This is called Modularity. At a genetic level, integration can be caused by for instance pleiotropy or Genetic linkage.

![horse with packages.png](/horse%20with%20packages.png)

Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Mutation in a pleiotropic gene may have an effect on several traits simultaneously. The underlying mechanism is genes that code for a product that is either used by various cells or has a cascade-like signalling function that affects various targets (so a ‘snow-ball effect’). Pleiotropy can have an effect on the evolutionary rate of genes and allele frequencies. Traditionally, models of pleiotropy have predicted that evolutionary rate of genes is related negatively with pleiotropy – as the number of traits of an organism increases, the evolutionary rates of genes in the organism's population decrease. This relationship has not been clearly found in empirical studies for a long time. However, a study based on human disease genes revealed the evidence of lower evolutionary rate in genes with higher pleiotropy.

I think this is quiet easy to explain. If there is a (potential) focused trait pushing the evolution, this can compensate the expected decrease (because it takes more efforts to reach ‘harmony’) and where this is not so, this decrease will be there, as expected (not compensated by more than random mutations).

Genetic linkage involves multiple genes being inherited together because they are close to each other on the same chromosome. Alleles at different loci can be inherited together if they are tightly linked. Transposition allows the loci at different locations on the chromosome to move so that they can become close to each other and be inherited together.

An important example of phenotypic integration evolving over time is the relationship between the number of bones in the brain and the size of the brain. Over the last 150 million years the number of bones in the brain has decreased while the size of the brain in mammals has grown. Integration between the brain and the skull has evolved over this time period to reduce the number of bones in the skull, while increasing the size of the brain.

![art birds and bats.png](/art%20birds%20and%20bats.png)

New Cornell University researchers (Andrew Orkney and Brandon Hedrick) have found that, unlike birds, the evolution of bats' wings and legs is tightly coupled, which may have prevented them from filling as many ecological niches as birds. It was expected that the evolution of bats was similar to that of birds, and that their wings and legs evolved independently of one another. But the opposite was found. The researchers observed in both bats and birds that the shapes of the bones within a species' wing or within a species' leg are correlated. Meaning that within a limb, bones evolve together. However, when looking at the legs and wings, the results were completely different: Bird species showed little to no correlation, whereas bats show strong correlation. This means that, contrary to birds, bats' forelimbs and hindlimbs did not evolve independently. So this suggests a coupled evolution of wing and leg. This coupled evolution had two positive effects on the speed of evolution. Less favourable mutations were needed and ‘harmony’ was easier to reach.

How could possibility 2. work?

One can imagine that a trait can be present it the genotype and even the phenotype without any function, as long as it does not have any (decisive) negative effects. We as humans have at least 100 of these so called vestigial anomalies. The most renowned are the appendix, wisdom teeth, coccyx and male nipples. So, for instance, if because of a mutation some men are going to develop mammary glands, the last attributes will prove to be handy and so don’t have to develop independently (by coincidence). The definition of Vestigially is the retention, during the process of evolution, of genetically determined structures or attributes that have lost some or all of the ancestral function in a given species. But in accordance with NI and ExT these structures or attributes are not remnants of an ancestral function but Phenotypic conditions that will make possible future evolutions of more complex traits, easier and so more likely.

So the above mentioned processes of coupled mutations and already in a dormant state present traits makes a fundamental new trait, that needs 50 mutations to happen, significantly less unlikely. A (potential) focused trait and the basics of new traits already being there, also make such a evolutionary process way more easy to accept. But is this enough for time to do its work? I doubt it. So what other possibilities are there to switch for ‘still not very likely’ to ‘a real possibility’?

The theory presented here is that the these kinds of processes can be split in a few mayor steps that each on its own results in a viable result (or at least not a mortal result). Not a ‘survival of the fittest’ but a fit that is good enough to survive. So let’s take a look at the switch from ‘laying eggs’ to giving birth’. It is imaginable that this process happened in the following mayor steps:

1. ‘Laying eggs only’ switching to the capability of laying eggs and giving birth.
2. Laying eggs switching to laying eggs in combination with suckling.
3. Giving birth in combination with suckling (end result)

The first step could be from ‘laying eggs’ to 1. and second step from 1. to 3. Or the first step could be from ‘laying eggs’ to 2. and the second step from 2. to 3. It is also imaginable that ‘halfway’ there is an interaction between 1. and 2.

![laying eggs.png](/laying%20eggs.png)

Each of these steps on their own need less mutations to complete the (partly) transition, so is more likely to happen. If indeed these intermediate results lead to a viable species (internal fit) and to another fit (‘survival of the fittest’ is no option in this situation). In the first situation (from ‘laying eggs to 1.) that should be a possibility. And indeed there are living species that have both capabilities. Different from how it works with animals which are capable of doing only one of both, but still indeed doing both separately (for instance depending on external circumstances; like water fleas and aphids). There are also animals which combine both ways, for instance by laying eggs and putting them back inside, like the echidna. The female puts the eggs in a pouch to breed them there. This is, by the way, not an animal that therefor has to be considered as an ancestor because, as I have described before, certain evolutionary processes can happen in different lineages independently from each other. According to ExT, because the basics on the concerning evolving traits are present in DNA right from the beginning. So in one lineage the process of ‘giving birth’ stopped halfway, maybe because the fit was good enough or maybe because ‘giving birth’ changed from a focused trait to a normal trait, while in other lineages this process leading to ‘giving birth’ was completely followed through, so till 3. was reached.

![echidna.png](/echidna.png)

Laying eggs in combination with suckling does also exist (so the result of the transition from ‘laying eggs’ to 2). The most well know species is the platypus. So also a result, that in specific circumstances needs no further evolutionary steps to offer an existence but in other circumstances it does.

The above learns us that the process of ‘laying eggs’ to ‘giving birth’ can be split in two or maybe even more steps, that each on their own can give a viable result. It also learns us that traits, that look to compete with each other, can be present at the same time in own species. So indeed there can be an evolutionary slowly but surely build-up of traits, not having any (essential) function yet, but also not harming anybody. That implies that all the 50 mutations don’t need to happen during the same period in a specific order.

So how can NI+ExT explain an evolutionary process that demands a lot (say 50) mutations to reach the ‘needed’ end result, without the driving force of ‘survival of the fittest’ (because each mutation on its own brings nothing like that):

1. The process from laying eggs to giving birth is split into a few mayor steps. Each step gives an viable result;
2. Each of this steps is ‘driven’ by a focused trait;
3. The basics of this trait are present in the DNA of almost all, if not all, species (in the status of a potential focused trait or as a trait, that at a certain moment during evolution switches to a potential focused trait). Also the basics of the other needed traits are already present;
4. Not all the needed traits, that per main step have to be there to combine with the evolution propelled by the focused trait, have to evolve during this process. Some may already have been there for some or even for a long time, being (virtually) useless until the change to ‘giving birth’ started and was accomplished;
5. Along with the process, that changes the genotype and phenotype, initiated by the focused trait, some other mutations happen. Some of them support ‘giving birth’ but some of them may hinder ‘laying eggs’;
6. Some mutations concerning ‘giving birth’ initiate other mutations, also relevant for the trait of ‘giving birth’.
