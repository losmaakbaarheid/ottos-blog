# The Origin Of Traits

I have already indicated that in my opinion a significant part of the DNA and genes in this DNA, describing the basics of many of the specific traits in which living species evolve and eventually may excel, were already present from the start of life. So in the DNA of the one cell species with which the evolution of life began. Ready to evolve and, in a certain phase or phases, waiting to be switched on. Is that a possibility? Yes I think so. A one cell species contains approximately 2 meters of DNA. And this equals at least 3 billion nucleotides. That is 3 x 109. This nucleotides represent the program of DNA. Seeing this huge number it is not unlikely that the basics of a big percentage of all biological possibilities of nature were already in DNA right from the start. Also the life of every animal, plant and human starts with just one cell. By the way: this makes the statement that only 2% of the human DNA is useful (encodes proteins) and 98% useless, extremely questionable. Parts of this 98% may have no use for humans and other species as we know them today but could have had and/or could have in the future an important function by encoding proteins in ancestors, successors, other animals, plants, at other moments in the evolution of life. By the way: recent research already indicates that at least a part of the mentioned 98% is in reality not useless.

So in my opinion the findings concerning the evolution of feathers can have far reaching implications. The resemblance between the DNA of different species could possibly be not an evidence of an evolutionary process during which one species evolves into another species but of the fact that DNA already from the start of life had many genetic possibilities concerning basic traits incorporated and so because of this start, the DNA of different species have ‘so much’ in common.

A whole lot of information is already included in one cell and what information is finally used to become a specific capability or trait, is a process of switching on parts of the DNA in this cell. That determines which proteins are going to be produced, which in their turn has a decisive effect on the traits connected with these parts. Of course other traits can play their roll and possibly some more modifications are needed, but it all starts with this switching on of the incorporated basics of the concerning trait. This is nothing special but a process that happens in every newborn. Every living creature starts out as a single cell. This cell splits and these new cells develop into all kind of more specific cells. For instance after fertilization a human cell splits into more than 200 different cell types, like skin cells, liver cells, bone cells, blood cells and so on. Although these cell types look and function differently they contain exactly the same DNA. Chemical processes modify DNA without changing the actual DNA sequence. Genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the development of the cells and which is translated into proteins. Depending on which genes are active at specific times during the development of a cell, the cell develops into a certain cell type. So in this first cell, with which an individual life starts, the basics of all these organs and body parts have to be already present.
