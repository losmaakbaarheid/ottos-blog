# The Origin Of Traits

I have already indicated that in my opinion a significant part of the DNA and genes in this DNA, describing the basics of many of the specific traits in which living species evolve and eventually may excel, were already present from the start of life. So in the DNA of the one cell species with which the evolution of life began. Ready to evolve and, in a certain phase or phases, waiting to be switched on. Is that a possibility? Yes I think so. A one cell species contains approximately 2 meters of DNA. And this equals at least 3 billion nucleotides. That is 3 x 109. This nucleotides represent the program of DNA. Seeing this huge number it is not unlikely that the basics of a big percentage of all biological possibilities of nature were already in DNA right from the start. Also the life of every animal, plant and human starts with just one cell. By the way: this makes the statement that only 2% of the human DNA is useful (encodes proteins) and 98% useless, extremely questionable. Parts of this 98% may have no use for humans and other species as we know them today but could have had and/or could have in the future an important function by encoding proteins in ancestors, successors, other animals, plants, at other moments in the evolution of life. By the way: recent research already indicates that at least a part of the mentioned 98% is in reality not useless.

So in my opinion the findings concerning the evolution of feathers can have far reaching implications. The resemblance between the DNA of different species could possibly be not an evidence of an evolutionary process during which one species evolves into another species but of the fact that DNA already from the start of life had many genetic possibilities concerning basic traits incorporated and so because of this start, the DNA of different species have ‘so much’ in common.

A whole lot of information is already included in one cell and what information is finally used to become a specific capability or trait, is a process of switching on parts of the DNA in this cell. That determines which proteins are going to be produced, which in their turn has a decisive effect on the traits connected with these parts. Of course other traits can play their roll and possibly some more modifications are needed, but it all starts with this switching on of the incorporated basics of the concerning trait. This is nothing special but a process that happens in every newborn. Every living creature starts out as a single cell. This cell splits and these new cells develop into all kind of more specific cells. For instance after fertilization a human cell splits into more than 200 different cell types, like skin cells, liver cells, bone cells, blood cells and so on. Although these cell types look and function differently they contain exactly the same DNA. Chemical processes modify DNA without changing the actual DNA sequence. Genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the development of the cells and which is translated into proteins. Depending on which genes are active at specific times during the development of a cell, the cell develops into a certain cell type. So in this first cell, with which an individual life starts, the basics of all these organs and body parts have to be already present.

So one specific DNA sequence can lead to all kind of different body parts with all kinds of different functions which, on top of that, also work together. Knowing this, one could wonder why it should not be possible and even reasonable to extrapolate that to different species. One can also imagine that genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the evolution of life and so are translated into proteins that, at a certain moment in time, create a ‘new’ trait. So basically the needed sequence is already there, just the right molecular processes to develop this trait, have to happen. Maybe by coincidence or maybe triggered by internal or external influences. So the DNA of the one cell living creature could already have had the potential to develop new traits and so in this way offer the origine of all kind of new species, that are defined by these new traits. The blue print of the evolution of life could already have been there right from the start. To get all the different species, this blue print is probably not enough. In combination with internal genetical processes - like changing sequences, adding autonomous transposons and so on - and external circumstances, it is. But even that in a limited way, as I will show you.

How could that more in detail work: a gene, and with that the basics of a trait, already there waiting to be switched on. Recent research has showed that new traits or ‘switched on genes’ are not the result of a changed DNA sequence. In many species these sequences appear to be very much the same. You could think about a longer DNA, in which these extra length represents this ‘new’ trait. Wrong! For instance the length of the DNA of humans and animals like mouse, dogs and chimpanzees is about the same. And that also applies for the order of genes. When comparing mouse and human genomes, for example, biologists are able to identify a mouse counterpart for at least 99 percent of all human genes. So a gene-similarity among species is the rule. And this has been so during (at least a big part of) the evolution.

So, where are the differences between species come from, where are they settled? This is still a subject of intensive research, so a bit tricky subject. Some researchers claim that the difference is made by the different proteins, the coding genes produce. Other claim that these proteins don’t change much but that is about the change of the molecular processes that influence this protein-making by these genes. What they agree upon is that it is not only about the ingredients but also about the process: where and when the genes are switched on and off.

If we combine these insights, a new trait is the result of a new protein being made by a switched on gene and/or the outcome of a change in the mechanisms that influence this protein-making and/or the result of a different time and place, when and where these processes happen. Then we talk about the terms ‘epigenetic modifications’, ‘transcription factors’, non-coding DNA-sequences and the duplication of genes. It appears that important traits are more the result of the last three influences since changing the proteins, responsible for these traits, is quiet risky because of the possible large impact. So ‘new’ traits are not the product of changes concerning the DNA-sequence and/or the genes themselves. And there are clear restriction concerning changes of produced proteins. Or in other words: the same ‘machine’ (DNA) produces different species mainly due to other settings and other ways of operating.

![machine producing species.png](/machine%20producing%20species.png)

If we include this in the Theory of ExT, what does this mean? That the DNA-machine, that can produce all kinds of species, is there right from the beginning including the basic capabilities to produce all kinds of traits. Still improvements are needed to make complex traits. So during evolution this machine is improved bit by bit, maybe just by trying (coincidence). There is a manual and there is some staff with a basic training how to operate the machine. But the machine is extremely complex with an awful lot of buttons, clocks, possible processes and so on. So it takes very much time to get familiar with all the possibilities of the machine and to tune all the processes taking place within the machine. In time it more and more becomes clear what will be the outcome depending on when the ‘on’ buttons are pushed and when the ‘off buttons are pushed. And also in what order to do so. A ‘switched on gene’ leading to a ‘new’ trait, and possibly leading to a new species, is nothing more than a discovery (directed or non-directed) by the operators of the machine (the molecular processes) of the capabilities of the machine, to make again and again something new, that is possibly marketable (new fit or ‘survival of the fittest’).

Inside DNA the production of a new trait is like operators of a machine discovering an until recently unknown capacity of this machine - and how to handle that - which is capable to manufacture a new (possibly) marketable product. The input of materials does not change significantly; sometimes the amount per material may have to change a bit. The essence of this is that basically it indeed is and always has been (more or less) the same machine (right from the start).

Above I made an extrapolation comparing the development of an embryo with the development of a new species. At recent research confirms that both – splitting of cells and switching on genes and other molecular processes – have in common that it all starts with one DNA-sequence. During the development of an embryo the DNA does not change at all. And during the evolution of life these changes are often limited to even extremely limited. In my opinion especially this last finding is (almost) an evidence that my “Excitatus Theory’ (I will present in this chapter) is the right evolutionary theory or at least a theory that deserves attention and should be considered as a theory not less relevant than the Evolution Theory. I am aware that this sounds a bit presumptuous, but ok.  

![dna split in 3 species.png](/dna%20split%20in%203%20species.png)

Further on, I will discuss the origin of life and that it is hard to image something (life) originating from ‘nothing’ (combination of dead materials). But also during specification according to the Evolution Theory a more or less similar process is taking place over and over again. For instance, did the first species with the capability to sense noise develop the necessary DNA-code to do so out of nothing? How? How can a mutation or couple of mutations by coincidence lead to such a complete new feature and trait? Like screwing a car together and, because of a mistake (mutation), suddenly a refrigerator appears.

![car refrigirator1.png](/car%20refrigirator1.png)

So I think that of all primary traits developed by all species during the evolution of life the basics, offering to mutations the chance to develop these traits, must have been there from the start of life. This presence right from the start, and the switching on and off of the concerning parts of DNA, is the essence of the Excitatus Theory. To explain the difference between a primary and a secondary trait you should think of hair versus the quills of a porcupine or teeth versus tusks of an elephant.

The basic traits evolved during the first billions of years because every ‘simple’ and every (more) complex living creature needed them and because in this period these basic traits were good enough to make a decisive difference. And also because more complex traits will take more time to find a fit (‘survival of an internal fit’): it takes more time to find a viable and favourable combination with other traits.

I wiil give so more some support to this theory, it is good to know that the shaping of bodies of animals is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes (less than 10%), and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. For instance the giraffe does not have a gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Important in this respect is the so called ‘Toolkit genes’. This implicates a couple of genes that together define the body plan and the number, identity and pattern of body parts. They are qualified as highly conserved. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes determine their outcome. The protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. It concerns complex genes and complex working genes and this complexity enables these genes in the development of the embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Which has a determining effect on the result.

If the basics of all essential traits were already present in DNA right from the start and if a new trait can only evolve out of these basics and not out of zero, than this also implicates that traits, of which no basics are present in DNA, will never evolve during the evolution of life. So some traits should be excluded. Which one you and I wonder. I have been thinking about that. So what about flies flying like helicopters? Or fishes with some kind of organ looking like a propeller. Indeed these require a kind of joint that can turn 360 degrees. Maybe physically too difficult to incorporate in the phenotype? Mammals with 4 legs and 2 arms? Reptiles with incorporated air bubbles to stay longer under water? Animals that produce poisoned sweat if attacked?

![fish with propellor.jpeg](/fish%20with%20propellor.jpeg){style="height: 300px; margin: 0 auto;"}

Besides these possible useful traits you could expect, if traits indeed develop out of zero, at least the first beginnings of some useless traits. Difficult to imagine but maybe something like an organ to produce air bubbles, or an organ to cool air or make summersaults.

According to the Evolution Theory it was expected that the diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms would be reflected in diversity at the level of the sequences of genes. But research contradicts this. As John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner (two acknowledges biologists) have noted, there is an apparent paradox: "\_where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change\_". Small changes in toolbox genes cause significant changes in body structures. A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. So this fact, that a small fraction of genes determines the development of the body of a species, that these genes are present in all animals and that this basic genes are capable to produce an huge variation of body shapes, from snakes to elephants, is in my opinion not an evidence of some common ancestor but of one common ancestor: the one cell species with which it all began (often named LUCA) already carried this toolbox genes.

![luca1.png](/luca1.png)

This is the 4th key point of NI and ExT (the genes, that can produce the proteins needed for all basic traits, were already in their basics present in DNA from the start of life). And I have also arrived at the 5th key point and that is ‘tuning’.

That concerns the processes connected with the ‘survival of an internal fit’ and the ‘survival of the fittest”. I already presented non-focused traits, potential focused traits, focused traits and obstructive traits and the way they interact. Some of them are showing themselves in the species as we see and experience them and so, in connection with that, in fossils. I have showed how the trait ‘body weight’ hindered the potential focused trait of flying to become a focused trait. So no birds yet. In the beginning there was just no ‘survival of an interna fit’. And probably the first birds, that could only fly a bit, were still so heavy that they could not get high enough into the air to escape all animals hunting them. So not yet a ‘survival of an external fit’ or in the terms of the Evolution Theory no ‘survival of the fittest’. When the body weight dropped even more also this second hurdle was overcome and birds, as we know them, really appeared.

I have showed this also schematically. These kinds of processes - the tunning by time between traits that impact each other - happen in the ancestors of a new species, before one or more of these ancestors find the right tuning and so become(s) in person this ancestor. Researchers found, as already mentioned, that the codes for feathers were already there 100 million years before the first bird appeared. And according to ExT probably even right from the start. So this is a clear indication of how long this process of tuning can take before reaching a positive result.

I already described the function of toolbox genes and the big surprise that the shape of the body and body parts of every animal is controlled by the same genes. The complexity of this part of DNA is way less than was expected. The complexity lies in the way these genes are being activated, where and when. That is an extremely sensitive process that determines the outcome of these genes. That is where the tuning and also fine-tuning are coming in.

So during evolution we see two phenomena leading to more and more complex species. A moderate if not limited increase of the complexity of the genome and the development of a very complex guidance of the activities of the genes that determine the development of a species and also of every embryo of this species.
