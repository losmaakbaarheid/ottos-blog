# The Origin Of Traits

I have already indicated that in my opinion a significant part of the DNA and genes in this DNA, describing the basics of many of the specific traits in which living species evolve and eventually may excel, were already present from the start of life. So in the DNA of the one cell species with which the evolution of life began. Ready to evolve and, in a certain phase or phases, waiting to be switched on. Is that a possibility? Yes I think so. A one cell species contains approximately 2 meters of DNA. And this equals at least 3 billion nucleotides. That is 3 x 109. This nucleotides represent the program of DNA. Seeing this huge number it is not unlikely that the basics of a big percentage of all biological possibilities of nature were already in DNA right from the start. Also the life of every animal, plant and human starts with just one cell. By the way: this makes the statement that only 2% of the human DNA is useful (encodes proteins) and 98% useless, extremely questionable. Parts of this 98% may have no use for humans and other species as we know them today but could have had and/or could have in the future an important function by encoding proteins in ancestors, successors, other animals, plants, at other moments in the evolution of life. By the way: recent research already indicates that at least a part of the mentioned 98% is in reality not useless.

So in my opinion the findings concerning the evolution of feathers can have far reaching implications. The resemblance between the DNA of different species could possibly be not an evidence of an evolutionary process during which one species evolves into another species but of the fact that DNA already from the start of life had many genetic possibilities concerning basic traits incorporated and so because of this start, the DNA of different species have ‘so much’ in common.

A whole lot of information is already included in one cell and what information is finally used to become a specific capability or trait, is a process of switching on parts of the DNA in this cell. That determines which proteins are going to be produced, which in their turn has a decisive effect on the traits connected with these parts. Of course other traits can play their roll and possibly some more modifications are needed, but it all starts with this switching on of the incorporated basics of the concerning trait. This is nothing special but a process that happens in every newborn. Every living creature starts out as a single cell. This cell splits and these new cells develop into all kind of more specific cells. For instance after fertilization a human cell splits into more than 200 different cell types, like skin cells, liver cells, bone cells, blood cells and so on. Although these cell types look and function differently they contain exactly the same DNA. Chemical processes modify DNA without changing the actual DNA sequence. Genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the development of the cells and which is translated into proteins. Depending on which genes are active at specific times during the development of a cell, the cell develops into a certain cell type. So in this first cell, with which an individual life starts, the basics of all these organs and body parts have to be already present.

So one specific DNA sequence can lead to all kind of different body parts with all kinds of different functions which, on top of that, also work together. Knowing this, one could wonder why it should not be possible and even reasonable to extrapolate that to different species. One can also imagine that genes are turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at the right time during the evolution of life and so are translated into proteins that, at a certain moment in time, create a ‘new’ trait. So basically the needed sequence is already there, just the right molecular processes to develop this trait, have to happen. Maybe by coincidence or maybe triggered by internal or external influences. So the DNA of the one cell living creature could already have had the potential to develop new traits and so in this way offer the origine of all kind of new species, that are defined by these new traits. The blue print of the evolution of life could already have been there right from the start. To get all the different species, this blue print is probably not enough. In combination with internal genetical processes - like changing sequences, adding autonomous transposons and so on - and external circumstances, it is. But even that in a limited way, as I will show you.

How could that more in detail work: a gene, and with that the basics of a trait, already there waiting to be switched on. Recent research has showed that new traits or ‘switched on genes’ are not the result of a changed DNA sequence. In many species these sequences appear to be very much the same. You could think about a longer DNA, in which these extra length represents this ‘new’ trait. Wrong! For instance the length of the DNA of humans and animals like mouse, dogs and chimpanzees is about the same. And that also applies for the order of genes. When comparing mouse and human genomes, for example, biologists are able to identify a mouse counterpart for at least 99 percent of all human genes. So a gene-similarity among species is the rule. And this has been so during (at least a big part of) the evolution.

So, where are the differences between species come from, where are they settled? This is still a subject of intensive research, so a bit tricky subject. Some researchers claim that the difference is made by the different proteins, the coding genes produce. Other claim that these proteins don’t change much but that is about the change of the molecular processes that influence this protein-making by these genes. What they agree upon is that it is not only about the ingredients but also about the process: where and when the genes are switched on and off.

If we combine these insights, a new trait is the result of a new protein being made by a switched on gene and/or the outcome of a change in the mechanisms that influence this protein-making and/or the result of a different time and place, when and where these processes happen. Then we talk about the terms ‘epigenetic modifications’, ‘transcription factors’, non-coding DNA-sequences and the duplication of genes. It appears that important traits are more the result of the last three influences since changing the proteins, responsible for these traits, is quiet risky because of the possible large impact. So ‘new’ traits are not the product of changes concerning the DNA-sequence and/or the genes themselves. And there are clear restriction concerning changes of produced proteins. Or in other words: the same ‘machine’ (DNA) produces different species mainly due to other settings and other ways of operating.
