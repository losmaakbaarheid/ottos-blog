# Why Are Fossils Of Transition Forms Rare? page

Switching on and off of genes offers the opportunity to explain evolutionary processes the Evolution Theory can’t. At least in my opinion. I already mentioned the transition from quadrupedalism to bipedalism as a result of many mutations, where each individual mutation on its own would have offered zero better fit, if not a worse fit. Meaning that this process would have stopped as soon as it began if ‘survival of the fittest’ was the only engine of evolution.
