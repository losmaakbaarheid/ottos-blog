# Implications Of NI

There is question unanswered. If a region of DNA or a combination of regions of DNA are capable to introduce in time a new trait in which ‘a new species to be’ will find its evolutionary focus, then is the genetic basis of this trait already there and just waiting to be activated by a mutation or a couple of mutations? Or could this mutation or these mutations have such an impact that this region or these regions make such a radical change that this results in a complete new trait based on a complete new code and protein? Think for instance about flying. Does the capability of flying originate from small steps each in the form of changing DNA regions (according to the Evolution Theory even again and again by coincidence) or from the activation of the DNA regions where this ‘hidden’ feature of flying was already (latent) present? Maybe only the basics. Or could it be a combination of both?

A study (&#x5F;Feather Development Genes and Associated Regulatory Innovation Predate the Origin of Dinosauria_ by Craig B. Lowe at al.) published in the journal ‘Molecular Biology and Evolution’ showed that the DNA code that birds share and gives them their feathers has already been in DNA for hundreds of millions of years before anything resembling a feather appeared on a species.
