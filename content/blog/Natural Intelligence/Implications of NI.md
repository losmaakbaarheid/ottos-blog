# Implications Of NI

There is question unanswered. If a region of DNA or a combination of regions of DNA are capable to introduce in time a new trait in which ‘a new species to be’ will find its evolutionary focus, then is the genetic basis of this trait already there and just waiting to be activated by a mutation or a couple of mutations? Or could this mutation or these mutations have such an impact that this region or these regions make such a radical change that this results in a complete new trait based on a complete new code and protein? Think for instance about flying. Does the capability of flying originate from small steps each in the form of changing DNA regions (according to the Evolution Theory even again and again by coincidence) or from the activation of the DNA regions where this ‘hidden’ feature of flying was already (latent) present? Maybe only the basics. Or could it be a combination of both?

A study (\_Feather Development Genes and Associated Regulatory Innovation Predate the Origin of Dinosauria\_ by Craig B. Lowe at al.) published in the journal ‘Molecular Biology and Evolution’ showed that the DNA code that birds share and gives them their feathers has already been in DNA for hundreds of millions of years before anything resembling a feather appeared on a species.

About 100 million years before the first bird flew, almost the complete genetic code to make a feather was already present in the DNA of the ancestors of birds. This study also indicate that the shrinking of the body size and growing of their limbs made it possible for birds to get into the air (‘survival of an internal fit’). By the way: also humans carry the feather code. The reason that we don’t have feathers is that genes can do different job in relation to the production of proteins. So yes a switch could also results in feathers on humans.

 

So what can be concluded on the basis of these findings? That a switch from one focused trait to another, as presented in the NI theory, and qualified as a revolutionary evolution, can be a realistic scenario, because the basic DNA conditions needed to make the new trait can already be present, so can be switched on, can become dominant and evolve from there on. And also a switch from a none focused trait to a focused trait is an option. At least if the outcome of the mentioned research can be generalized. And so there is in that situation no need for a very slow evolutionary process during which feathers develop thanks to the ‘law’ of the ‘survival of the fittest’.

You may say: ok, that could be true but what about the process of a shrinking body and growing arms over a long period? Though the cited article does not go into that, one can imagine that there are also a DNA sequence and genes for this effect. And that they were already present long before the first bird would fly. So switching on of these genes at a certain moment was enough to start the development of the species of birds. So the combination, at probably two different moments in evolution, of two revolutionary evolutions could have done the trick: making the production of feathers a focused trait and also making the shrinking of the body and lengthening of the arms a second focused trait. There is even a more simple scenario possible. The shrinking of the body and/or the growing of the arms could have been the result of a random evolution that appeared to be essential to clear the way to make the directional evolution concerning the development of feathers finally (after being there for 100 million years already) viable.

Or in NI-language: the outcome of the ‘survival of the fittest’ became positive because the obstructive traits of weight and short arms became less limiting so the potential focused trait of flying could take its chance to become a focused trait (was no longer only a part of the genotype in the context of a higher susceptibility). One can also imagine a process the other way around: losing weight was the focused trait and the weight reduction gave the, so far not usable trait of developing wings, the opportunity to offer a better or even a best fit. And gave the opportunity to the birds to finally get off of the ground. Further on I will show you that this are indeed plausible scenarios.
