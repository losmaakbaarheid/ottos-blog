# Implications Of NI

There is question unanswered. If a region of DNA or a combination of regions of DNA are capable to introduce in time a new trait in which ‘a new species to be’ will find its evolutionary focus, then is the genetic basis of this trait already there and just waiting to be activated by a mutation or a couple of mutations? Or could this mutation or these mutations have such an impact that this region or these regions make such a radical change that this results in a complete new trait based on a complete new code and protein? Think for instance about flying. Does the capability of flying originate from small steps each in the form of changing DNA regions (according to the Evolution Theory even again and again by coincidence) or from the activation of the DNA regions where this ‘hidden’ feature of flying was already (latent) present? Maybe only the basics. Or could it be a combination of both?

A study (\_Feather Development Genes and Associated Regulatory Innovation Predate the Origin of Dinosauria\_ by Craig B. Lowe at al.) published in the journal ‘Molecular Biology and Evolution’ showed that the DNA code that birds share and gives them their feathers has already been in DNA for hundreds of millions of years before anything resembling a feather appeared on a species.

About 100 million years before the first bird flew, almost the complete genetic code to make a feather was already present in the DNA of the ancestors of birds. This study also indicate that the shrinking of the body size and growing of their limbs made it possible for birds to get into the air (‘survival of an internal fit’). By the way: also humans carry the feather code. The reason that we don’t have feathers is that genes can do different job in relation to the production of proteins. So yes a switch could also results in feathers on humans.

So what can be concluded on the basis of these findings? That a switch from one focused trait to another, as presented in the NI theory, and qualified as a revolutionary evolution, can be a realistic scenario, because the basic DNA conditions needed to make the new trait can already be present, so can be switched on, can become dominant and evolve from there on. And also a switch from a none focused trait to a focused trait is an option. At least if the outcome of the mentioned research can be generalized. And so there is in that situation no need for a very slow evolutionary process during which feathers develop thanks to the ‘law’ of the ‘survival of the fittest’.

You may say: ok, that could be true but what about the process of a shrinking body and growing arms over a long period? Though the cited article does not go into that, one can imagine that there are also a DNA sequence and genes for this effect. And that they were already present long before the first bird would fly. So switching on of these genes at a certain moment was enough to start the development of the species of birds. So the combination, at probably two different moments in evolution, of two revolutionary evolutions could have done the trick: making the production of feathers a focused trait and also making the shrinking of the body and lengthening of the arms a second focused trait. There is even a more simple scenario possible. The shrinking of the body and/or the growing of the arms could have been the result of a random evolution that appeared to be essential to clear the way to make the directional evolution concerning the development of feathers finally (after being there for 100 million years already) viable.

Or in NI-language: the outcome of the ‘survival of the fittest’ became positive because the obstructive traits of weight and short arms became less limiting so the potential focused trait of flying could take its chance to become a focused trait (was no longer only a part of the genotype in the context of a higher susceptibility). One can also imagine a process the other way around: losing weight was the focused trait and the weight reduction gave the, so far not usable trait of developing wings, the opportunity to offer a better or even a best fit. And gave the opportunity to the birds to finally get off of the ground. Further on I will show you that this are indeed plausible scenarios.

Any other examples of obstructive traits blocking or limiting the use of a focused trait? Earlier I already mentioned the latent capability of humans to have a hibernation. Another one? Ok this becomes a bit more tricky. I would not surprise me if there are one or more traits that put a limit to our ways of thinking and our fantasy. If you miss that obstructive trait on the one hand you could get a trait that offers you the capability to imagine and realize things other people can’t, but on the other hand life can become quite difficult to live. I am talking about for example Vincent van Gogh, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Jim Morrison and Amy Winehouse. People who were unique and were capable of incomparable achievements. But on the other hand life was sometimes very hard for them, not seldomly resulting in the abuse of drugs and alcohol. The brains of Einstein only weighted 1.230 gram; significantly less than the average weight of about 1.400 gram of the brains of a grown up man.

I think there is even another example, if we are talking about mankind. Hardcore criminals do also miss a trait that should have limited their criminal behaviour and the boldness of their actions. So special talents may not be the result of something extra but of something less. Obstructive traits may not only limit the benefits of a focused trait but also their downturns.

The origin of birds as a result of the existence of the feather-code in DNA long before the origin of the first bird, and so giving the chance to completely develop this trait at the right moment in time, is way more plausible than the theory that a bird evolved out of a reptile by hundreds of coincidental small steps. It is completely unclear to me how each of this tinny steps, say for instance a skin changing from 2 feather like hairs per square inch to four of them, could ever implicate a better fit and so reduce the animals with just 2 of these feather like hairs per square inch to losers with none or with less offspring as a result. So the origin of birds can by explained with NI, or to be exact on the basis of revolutionary evolution, where the origin of the huge variety of birds can be explained as an evolutionary process on the basis of random and/or directional mutations.

To give another example.

**Scenario 1:** The first move from water to land started by some curious fishes that moved out of water and consequently died. And then at a certain moment one of the fishes acquired by coincidence the capability to survive out of the water for a short period of time. And by another coincidence (coincidence x coincidence) also this fish tried, despite of the death of its ancestors, to go out of the water, and so didn’t die. And this new fit started from there its evolution.

**Scenario 2:** A fish acquired (by switching on a certain DNA-region) the capability to survive out of the water for a short period of time and by coincidence discovered (coincidence x coincidence) this new trait and made use of it to catch prey that was out of reach for his a her colleagues. And this new fit started from there on its evolution.

**Scenario 3:** Due to a revolutionary evolution from time to time some fishes acquired (by switching on a certain DNA-region) the capability to survive out of the water for a short period of time. For one or a few species of fish this new trait could be fitted in. This was an (inheritable) focused trait but none of the fishes with this mutation was aware of it. So the group of fishes with this trait is growing steadily. At one moment one of them by coincidence (coincidence x < coincidence) discovered this new trait and made use of it to catch prey that was out of reach for his a her colleagues. And this new fit started from there on its evolution.
