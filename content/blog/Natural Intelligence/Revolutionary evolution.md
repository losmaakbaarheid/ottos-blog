# Revolutionary Evolution

Another interesting and important question is if NI can explain the origin and development of a ‘complete’ new (type of) species, the so called specification. In all articles I was able to trace, I did not find one real and direct evidence that random mutations followed by the principal of ‘survival of the fittest’ have ever given any real new species. So I am not talking about birds with different beaks or about basils becoming resistant against antibiotics. These are only indications that are interpreted as a more or less evidence.  

Another relevant finding is that fossils of so called ‘transition forms’ between two kinds of species, between which there are clear resemblances, are extremely rare and often don’t existent. Time of course can have to do with this but still it raises questions. And there are discussions going on between palaeontologists, when an unknown fossils is found, about its evolutionary context. See for instance this text dated December 2014 in Understanding Evolution (Berkeley.edu):

_In the vast majority of cases, the fossil “ancestors” or “missing links” reported by the media are, according the scientists behind the research, actually not ancestors at all; they are close relatives of those ancestors._ 

There is no definite accepted insight in how new species according to the Evolution Theory arise. But mostly the following steps are mentioned:

1. Isolation of two populations of a certain species
2. This means that different traits will be selected by natural selection (because both populations live under different circumstances).
3. Over time the two populations become so different that they cannot longer interbreed
4. A new species is formed
