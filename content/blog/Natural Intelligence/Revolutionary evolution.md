# Revolutionary Evolution

Another interesting and important question is if NI can explain the origin and development of a ‘complete’ new (type of) species, the so called specification. In all articles I was able to trace, I did not find one real and direct evidence that random mutations followed by the principal of ‘survival of the fittest’ have ever given any real new species. So I am not talking about birds with different beaks or about basils becoming resistant against antibiotics. These are only indications that are interpreted as a more or less evidence.  

Another relevant finding is that fossils of so called ‘transition forms’ between two kinds of species, between which there are clear resemblances, are extremely rare and often don’t existent. Time of course can have to do with this but still it raises questions. And there are discussions going on between palaeontologists, when an unknown fossils is found, about its evolutionary context. See for instance this text dated December 2014 in Understanding Evolution (Berkeley.edu):

_In the vast majority of cases, the fossil “ancestors” or “missing links” reported by the media are, according the scientists behind the research, actually not ancestors at all; they are close relatives of those ancestors._ 

There is no definite accepted insight in how new species according to the Evolution Theory arise. But mostly the following steps are mentioned:

1. Isolation of two populations of a certain species
2. This means that different traits will be selected by natural selection (because both populations live under different circumstances).
3. Over time the two populations become so different that they cannot longer interbreed
4. A new species is formed

In this description ‘isolation’ is a clear condition. Not all scientists concerning the Evolution Theory agree upon this, by the way. But without step 1., finding a scenario that results in a new species, becomes rather hard. At least on the basis of the Evolution Theory.

First and for all, as already mentioned, this process of specification based on the two principles of the Evolution Theory, has never been witnessed, has never been recorded and has never been proven by fossils or in any other way. Only situations in our time, resemblances between the DNA of different species, the processes happening within an embryo and so on, have been interpreted as a kind of evidence of such a process. But that is nothing less and also nothing more than a theory (like mine). And later on I will give another possible explanation for these resemblances and these processes.

Survival of the fittest leads according to the Evolution Theory on and on to the improvement of a trait in which a certain species excels or at least that is important to survive. So this trait becomes better and better again and again. If I make again a comparison with cars you could compare this with the evolution of a certain brand of say four-door saloons during which every new model is faster or more comfortable or uses less fuel. But it will always stay a car competing over and over again with the same brands which are manufactured on the basis of these same qualities. Without a dramatic change this four-door saloon will never become an EV, a SUV, a truck and so on.

Or going back to the felines in Africa and America: their differences are still limited, their ways to sneak up on their prey, the kind of food they eat and so on are not fundamentally different. Only lions differ a bit. If you would bring these cats from the different continents together they will start to compete with each other for the same territories and prey. So no principle difference, like between men and apes, which don’t compete in the way they ‘haunt’ and the food they eat (at least partly, apes rarely eat meat for instance). So the essence of this is that evolution based on random mutations needs isolation as a clear condition for a new species to be able to arise. And that the differences between both species, resulting from their separate evolutions, remain, so it seems, limited even over a period of millions of years.

To summarize it: the existence of different kind of felines on different continents could be the result of specification according to the Evolution Theory: no big differences and isolation as a condition. But the existence of men and apes next to each other can’t be explained on the basis of this theory: way more essential differences and lacking the condition of isolation.

So how can a new species arise without isolation or how can a bigger difference between two species evolve? When our common ancestors split into apes and mankind Africa was a continent like it is today. So, as already mentioned, isolation could not have been the start of the different evolutions.
