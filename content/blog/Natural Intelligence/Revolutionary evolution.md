# Revolutionary Evolution

Another interesting and important question is if NI can explain the origin and development of a ‘complete’ new (type of) species, the so called specification. In all articles I was able to trace, I did not find one real and direct evidence that random mutations followed by the principal of ‘survival of the fittest’ have ever given any real new species. So I am not talking about birds with different beaks or about basils becoming resistant against antibiotics. These are only indications that are interpreted as a more or less evidence.  

Another relevant finding is that fossils of so called ‘transition forms’ between two kinds of species, between which there are clear resemblances, are extremely rare and often don’t existent. Time of course can have to do with this but still it raises questions. And there are discussions going on between palaeontologists, when an unknown fossils is found, about its evolutionary context. See for instance this text dated December 2014 in Understanding Evolution (Berkeley.edu):

_In the vast majority of cases, the fossil “ancestors” or “missing links” reported by the media are, according the scientists behind the research, actually not ancestors at all; they are close relatives of those ancestors._ 

There is no definite accepted insight in how new species according to the Evolution Theory arise. But mostly the following steps are mentioned:

1. Isolation of two populations of a certain species
2. This means that different traits will be selected by natural selection (because both populations live under different circumstances).
3. Over time the two populations become so different that they cannot longer interbreed
4. A new species is formed

In this description ‘isolation’ is a clear condition. Not all scientists concerning the Evolution Theory agree upon this, by the way. But without step 1., finding a scenario that results in a new species, becomes rather hard. At least on the basis of the Evolution Theory.

First and for all, as already mentioned, this process of specification based on the two principles of the Evolution Theory, has never been witnessed, has never been recorded and has never been proven by fossils or in any other way. Only situations in our time, resemblances between the DNA of different species, the processes happening within an embryo and so on, have been interpreted as a kind of evidence of such a process. But that is nothing less and also nothing more than a theory (like mine). And later on I will give another possible explanation for these resemblances and these processes.

Survival of the fittest leads according to the Evolution Theory on and on to the improvement of a trait in which a certain species excels or at least that is important to survive. So this trait becomes better and better again and again. If I make again a comparison with cars you could compare this with the evolution of a certain brand of say four-door saloons during which every new model is faster or more comfortable or uses less fuel. But it will always stay a car competing over and over again with the same brands which are manufactured on the basis of these same qualities. Without a dramatic change this four-door saloon will never become an EV, a SUV, a truck and so on.

Or going back to the felines in Africa and America: their differences are still limited, their ways to sneak up on their prey, the kind of food they eat and so on are not fundamentally different. Only lions differ a bit. If you would bring these cats from the different continents together they will start to compete with each other for the same territories and prey. So no principle difference, like between men and apes, which don’t compete in the way they ‘haunt’ and the food they eat (at least partly, apes rarely eat meat for instance). So the essence of this is that evolution based on random mutations needs isolation as a clear condition for a new species to be able to arise. And that the differences between both species, resulting from their separate evolutions, remain, so it seems, limited even over a period of millions of years.

To summarize it: the existence of different kind of felines on different continents could be the result of specification according to the Evolution Theory: no big differences and isolation as a condition. But the existence of men and apes next to each other can’t be explained on the basis of this theory: way more essential differences and lacking the condition of isolation.

So how can a new species arise without isolation or how can a bigger difference between two species evolve? When our common ancestors split into apes and mankind Africa was a continent like it is today. So, as already mentioned, isolation could not have been the start of the different evolutions.

Can the possible existence of NI give a better explanation for specification without isolation or for the origin of a fundamentally different species? Yes I think so and I will explain why.

According to the theory given in the prior text in the genome there is or can be a susceptibility for specific mutations that influences or even more of less can dictate the direction of the evolution of a species. This susceptibility is basically a more than random chance on an inheritable genetic variation. Not only of this variation itself but also of the bigger than random chance that this variation will happen again. And this in its turn is the result of conditions in or around the regions of the DNA that determine the traits that evolve in this way. A change concerning this inheritable non-random genetic variation(s) may lead to a fundamental change that has an effect on the Natural Intelligence. Which implies a change effecting its direction and/or strength, its sensitivity and/or of the circumstances that can activate NI (if talking about active susceptibility). This genetic change from one focused trait to another focused trait or of a trait changing in its way of evolving or from say 20 focused traits to 21 focused traits, can (in time) have way more impacts and consequences than the slow step by step partly(!) different evolutions of two groups of the same species that have become isolated from each other.

The changes concerning the genetic focus of NI doesn’t by definition lead to a better fit but to the potency of another fit. That the situation after the change towards a new, an extra or a fundamentally adjusted inheritable non-random chance for specific mutations also gives a fit is of course a condition. All other changes concerning the NI will have no viability and will sooner or later lead to death and extinction of the concerning new evolutionary branch. The change of the NI may be a process of small steps following each other but more likely is a change with an invisible but on a genetic level more abrupt impact. This in accordance with recent findings that established which effects DNA and RNA can have on the production of a different and new type of protein resulting in their turn into different cellular processes and so in the end to a possible new species. Probably the speed of change is also dependent on the complexity of a trait. If this trait is determined by a large number of genes (alleles) or by a combination of traits one can expect that a step-by-step process is the only way to reach a noticeable effect. So it will take many years to reach that situation but still in evolutionary perspective quiet abrupt.

It is even imaginable that a new/changed focused trait will only show its evolutionary effects after a long period of time, for example millions of years, because other focused or non-focused traits will hinder the species to make use of this trait. If these other trait(s) evolve(s) in such a way, that this hindrance diminishes or even disappears in time, the new trait can start to flourish and so give a boost to the evolution of this species (survival of an internal fit). Another possibility is that the concerning focused trait itself evolves in such a way that it can overcome this hinderance.

So how could this work? A focused trait no showing itself? A change in the DNA has to go through a couple of phases before it impacts the phenotype:

Genotype (DNA sequence) → Transcription → RNA → Translation → Proteins → Phenotype

The gene must be activated. Next the DNA sequence is transcribed into RNA. Then RNA is translated into proteins which influence the phenotype.

During this process things can go wrong or can get stuck due to all kind of influences. Having proper gene activation, regulatory mechanisms, developmental signals, and functional pathways are all essential. A trait can remain at the molecular or biochemical phenotype stage without developing into an observable physical or behavioural trait. And even if all conditions are met, still traits can be suppressed through for instance genetic dominance, epistatic interactions, epigenetic regulation and environmental influences. In the last situation well known qualifications are dormant and hidden traits. So hidden traits are an integral part of genetics, representing the potential for phenotypic variation that may not be immediately apparent. They play a crucial role in inheritance, evolution, and genetic diversity, often revealing themselves under specific conditions or in future generations.

But according to NI there is another mechanism that can block the development of a trait and especially of a focused trait. Not on a molecular or chemical level but on a physical level. One can imagine that due to a higher susceptibility one mutation happens with a more than random frequence: the focused trait. But the situation could be there that every time this mutation happens, it will result in a combination of traits that is not viable. ‘No survival of an internal fit’. For instance walking upright (as focused trait) without the right balance. So this situation, appearing after relatively short intervals again and again due to the same mutation, leads to a species tumbling over after every step. Not really a favourable result. Or when a situation of balance is reached but most of the food, this species digest, grows on ground level. So no ‘survival of the fittest’. Only if a trait, that leads to a good balance standing upright (internal fit), is present and only if the right kind of food also grows on trees (external fit), the potential focused trait of walking upright, will not any longer lead to death and so the focused trait mutation finally lead to a new species showing itself in a new phenotype: the upright walking creature.

![olifant overeind.png](/olifant%20overeind.png){style="height: 300px; margin: 0 auto;"}

Till that moment the (new) focused trait of walking upright, is only an imaginary or potential focused trait ‘hanging in the air’ because of its ‘regular’ appearance due to a more than random mutation, that can imply this trait. It is like a trait knocking on the door from time to time, hoping that a moment will come that somebody opens the door (i.e. reaching an internal and external fit). Going through this door leads to a new genotype and a new phenotype (in time). Further on we will see that this process happened during the evolution of birds. I call this a ‘potential focused trait’. The focused or non-focused trait that blocks the potential focused trait to become real, I call an ‘obstructive trait’. In the given example that is the body shape that does not give the right balance, if standing upright.
