# Directional Evolution

So how can evolution be guided without the need of the ‘hand of a god’? Until now we have seen intelligence as something that belongs to living creatures only. But Artificial Intelligence has shown us that this is not a condition. DNA looks much like a computer program and the last years computer programs have been developed with some kind of incorporated intelligence. So why should the DNA of humans and of other living creatures not also include some sort of intelligence? I have no clue why that should not be possible. You could say that it needs something super natural to add intelligence to DNA but then why does is not need that for programming a type of species? It is one or the other: or both parts of the DNA program were ‘written’ or no parts. And let us not forget that recent studies have shown us that indeed RNA, a molecule which looks to be as important for life as its ‘brother or sister’ DNA, shows some kind of intelligence: our cells contain a protein-directing machine, made of RNA and proteins, that sends newly made proteins to where they’re needed most in a cell. This machine is called the signal recognition particle (SRP) and so knows and decides where newly produced proteins will have the most benefits. Nothing random about it.

If you can imagine that a kind of ‘intelligence’ (intelligence not as ‘human intelligence’ but meaning circumstances in or influences acting on DNA/RNA leading to a clear direction in the evolution of a species) can be incorporated in the genome, many new possibilities come into view. That this ‘Artificial Intelligence’, or maybe ‘Natural Intelligence’ (NI) is a better word, is a condition that is there all the time and so can do its job all the time or only at the moments it is triggered.
