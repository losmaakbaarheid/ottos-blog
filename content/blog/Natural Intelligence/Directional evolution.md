# Directional Evolution

So how can evolution be guided without the need of the ‘hand of a god’? Until now we have seen intelligence as something that belongs to living creatures only. But Artificial Intelligence has shown us that this is not a condition. DNA looks much like a computer program and the last years computer programs have been developed with some kind of incorporated intelligence. So why should the DNA of humans and of other living creatures not also include some sort of intelligence? I have no clue why that should not be possible. You could say that it needs something super natural to add intelligence to DNA but then why does is not need that for programming a type of species? It is one or the other: or both parts of the DNA program were ‘written’ or no parts. And let us not forget that recent studies have shown us that indeed RNA, a molecule which looks to be as important for life as its ‘brother or sister’ DNA, shows some kind of intelligence: our cells contain a protein-directing machine, made of RNA and proteins, that sends newly made proteins to where they’re needed most in a cell. This machine is called the signal recognition particle (SRP) and so knows and decides where newly produced proteins will have the most benefits. Nothing random about it.

If you can imagine that a kind of ‘intelligence’ (intelligence not as ‘human intelligence’ but meaning \_circumstances in or influences acting on DNA/RNA leading to a clear direction in the evolution of a species\_\_\*) can be incorporated in the genome, many new possibilities come into view. That this ‘Artificial Intelligence’, or maybe \*\_‘Natural Intelligence’ (NI)\*\* is a better word, is a condition that is there all the time and so can do its job all the time or only at the moments it is triggered.

![NI =.png](/NI%20%3D.png){style="height: 50px; margin: 0 auto;"}

How could NI work? One could imagine that as a whole variations are random but on a species level or even on an individual level one variation is more likely to occur than another, for instance due to a lesser stability or a lesser protection against mutations of the concerning region or regions of their/its DNA/RNA. In fact recent research has revealed that mutations are not entirely random, so that in this respect the Evolution Theory is not accurate. For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’. This susceptibility could be there all the time or could be triggered by specific circumstances. The term ‘intelligence’ is even more to the point if this trigger is caused by a situation that needs a better fit in order to be evolutionary successful or even to survive.

You could think: what a ignorance or even arrogance to assume that mutations in DNA/RNA are not completely random while that is a fundamental axiom of the Evolution Theory. But in 2022 J.G. Monroe at al. published in ‘Nature’ some remarkable findings (by the way: they are not completely undisputed).

![mutation bias.png](/mutation%20bias.png){style="height: 50px; margin: 0 auto;"}

They found that the genetic variation in a genome was not random and tended to be much lower around parts of the genome involved in the most important traits of the investigated species (plant called Arabidopsis). These parts seemed to be protected from mutations and in the same regions DNA damage repair seemed to act more actively. You can imagine that this sounds quiet logic because mutations/damages in these parts could easily finish the viability of the concerning living creature. In the same regions inhibiting epigenetic features were more common. As the word says they inhibit mutations. And it becomes even more striking. They also found that these epigenetic features were less than average present in and around the more specialized genes that were associated with environmental responses and so will have a bigger chance on genetic variations. So the genes responsible for adapting to a changing environment. And finally these scientists stated that these mutations seemed to be more important than natural selection to adapt to these changing circumstances. If these findings are accurate and will be supported by other findings resulting from research on other species, the presented theory of a directional evolution will become will get a scientific basis.

One can even wonder if something like a ‘positive susceptibility’ could be possible: that the chances on a positive mutation becomes larger and the chances on a neutral or negative mutation smaller. RNA knows where the proteins are needed the most. So if SRP knows where proteins are the most needed maybe there is also something like a molecular process that repairs negative mutations but don’t react on positive mutations. Does that demand too much intelligence of the DNA? Could be, so I won’t go that way and still let the evolution of a trait and the internal and external circumstances decide what is a positive mutation and what isn’t.

**In this presentation ‘susceptibility’ is defined as a greater than random chance to get a mutation in the concerning region of the genome influencing one or more specific traits of a species, due to a trigger activated by interior or exterior circumstances affecting this region (‘active susceptibility’) and/or due to a lesser than average protection against mutation of this region (‘passive susceptibility’) and/or due to any other genome related influence leading to a greater than random chance of a specific mutation.**

The theory that external or internal circumstances could favour specific mutations looks even more a contradiction opposite to the random mutations according to the Evolution Theory. So even more a bold statement. But Wielgos S at all. published in 2013 results from a research with the title “\_Mutation rate dynamics in a bacterial population reflect tension between adaptation and genetic load\_”. And they found that bacteria showed hypermutability in order to adapt to new conditions. And in this document the researchers wrote about a strong influence from the environment. So they found a clear relation between the circumstances in the outside world and the occurrence of mutations. They even wrote that this hypermutation enabled a population to avoid extinction. It is not clear, if these mutations were random or in accordance with their NI. But you can imagine that an extreme number of mutations within a short period going in every direction is waste and is like shooting with buckshot on a fly. No, far worse than that! Because if a huge number of random mutations happen by far the highest percentage of these would be negative so this would increase the life threatening situation instead of the opposite.

Another research done by Toon Swings at al. published with the tittle “\_Adaptive tuning of mutation rates allows fast response to lethal stress in Escherichia coli\_” gave some information about that: \_specific mutations allow organism to adept to stressful environments. As soon as the right adaptation is reached, the mutation rate declines. Cellular mortality appeared to be the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates.\_

![adaptive tunning artikel.png](/adaptive%20tunning%20artikel.png){style="height: 50px; margin: 0 auto;"}

Devon M. Fitzgerald and Susan M. Rosenberg wrote in an article with the title “\_How microbes “jeopardize” the modern syntheses”\_ the following: \_Mutations were assumed to occur by chance: constantly, gradually, roughly uniformly in genomes and without regard to environmental input. But recent discoveries reveal a totally different picture of highly regulated mutagenesis, up-regulated temporally by stress responses and activated when cells/organisms are maladapted to their environment potentially accelerating adaption. And mutation is also not random in genomic space, with multiple simultaneous mutations in local clusters which may allow concerted evolution.\_

Very interesting words in these articles are:  

·       \_hypermutability in order to adapt to new conditions\_

·       \_a strong influence from the environment\_

·       \_hypermutation enables a population to avoid extinction\_

·       \_specific mutations allow organism to adept to stressful environments.\_

·       \_as soon as the right adaptation is reached, the mutation rate declines.\_

·       \_cellular mortality appeared to be the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates.\_

·       \_up-regulated temporally by stress responses and activated when cells/organisms are maladapted to their environment potentially accelerating adaption.\_

·       \_and mutation is also not random in genomic space, with multiple simultaneous mutations in local clusters which may allow concerted evolution.\_

Even more recent studies clearly indicate that evolution is not completely random and so not completely unpredictable. One more interesting study was published in the \_Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\_ (\_PNAS\_). This study was led by Professor James McInerney and Dr. Alan Beavan from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham, and Dr. Maria Rosa Domingo-Sananes from Nottingham Trent University.

One conclusion was that the evolutionary trajectory of a genome may be influenced by its evolutionary history, rather than determined by numerous factors and historical accidents. You could translate “influenced by its evolutionary history” as some kind of inheritability and as an evolutionary direction.

One research, and article based on the results, that could rebut these findings and so intends to confirm that mutations are as random as the Evolution Theory dictates, and as fiercely defended by evolutionists, has the name: \_A broad mutational target explains a fast rate of phenotypic evolution\_, written by Fabrice Besnard at al.

![a broad mutational target artikel.png](/a%20broad%20mutational%20target%20artikel.png){style="height: 50px; margin: 0 auto;"}

The abstract of this article states: \_The rapid evolution of a trait in a clade of organisms can be explained by the sustained action of natural selection or by a high mutational variance, that is the propensity to change under spontaneous mutation. The causes for a high mutational variance are still elusive.\_ Yes indeed: it is about this second sentence and especially about this last word ‘elusive’. What about a certain susceptibility in certain regions of the genome?

And the abstract finishes with: \_Our data indicate that a broad mutational target size is the cause of the high mutational variance and of the corresponding fast phenotypic evolutionary rate.\_ So, if I understand it well, the researchers claim that a more often, than random as to be expected, change of a trait, and so a faster evolution than other traits, is caused by the fact that the concerning trait is coded on more than one location on the genome, or even on a couple of these locations, and that a trait with less mutations is coded on one or just a few genes. So if one or a few genes are involved instead of many the mutation rate will be lower based on the happening of random mutations. As an example of a faster than random evolution of a trait, based on a multitude of locations, the large brain of primates is mentioned.

I feel the urge to make a couple of observations:

·       If the size of the brain of a primate is coded in several locations in their DNA, than would it not be logical to expect that this also concerns other mammals? Is there any reason to suspect that their brain size is coded at less locations? To me that doesn’t sound logical. And so if the number of locations is more or less comparable than why doesn’t this ‘broad mutational target’ work for these animals to also have a fast evolving brain?

·       More complex traits are often coded at more locations (loci) than simple traits. Do complex traits change more often? That would in my opinion really be a threat to the evolution of life in the direction of steadily more complex species.

·       If a trait is located on several locations and one of these regions mutates, will that by definition have an  (decisive) effect on this trait and so on the phenotype (the species with its traits as in looks like and appears in our world)? Could it not be the other way around? That if a trait is located on (quote) many genes, that this trait has a certain redundancy? So the capability to sustain a mutation without any or without a substantial impact? It looks to me more logical that a trait, which is coded in only region, is much more likely to be effected by one mutation if you are talking about the phenotype.

Let me limit the possibility of susceptible DNA-regions for a moment to the evolution of mankind, that has pushed us since the prehistoric times slowly but steadily towards an increasing human intelligence. That is the general opinion. If in our DNA it is programmed that a growing human intelligence is our focus of evolution, then what could trigger this program to be activated, if we are talking about an active susceptibility? A shortage of food could be such an event or of some specific nutrients. Or, maybe even more likely, a longer period of anxiety. Obviously these situations are life threatening and can be caused by not fitting properly anymore due to developments in the outside world. The shortage of food causes a lack of certain nutrients in our body that could give a signal to the region in our DNA/RNA that can initiate a ‘sudden’ change in our DNA, and to be more specific the regions that define our human intelligence. Anxiety produces specific hormones that could do the same. What a cell becomes, is determined by what molecular machines—RNAs and proteins—are operating in that cell. And those RNAs and proteins that are present in a cell are determined by transcription factors that switch genes on and off. So indeed RNA and proteins can switch genes on and off and so can change a cell and these cells in their turn can define the species. And also mutations in the RNA can result to new proteins and lead to fundamental changes in living cells. And it is not difficult to imagine that external influences like a shortage of specific nutrition’s or dying of cells could have such a triggering effect on these processes.

I wrote that in my opinion the human intelligence of say the Romans was not less than of humankind nowadays. So the conclusion could be that during the last 2000 years no significant mutations have taken place in the NI-regions of men, nor passively nor triggered by any circumstances. The latest could raise eyebrows because during this period there were wars, famines and other life threatening situations. Of course 2000 years is an in evolutionary context very short period, so if you look at it from the viewpoint of passive susceptibility that is not surprising. But from the viewpoint of active susceptibility this could raise questions. Does it really exist or is only passive susceptibility the possible way NI could work?

During the last 2000 years the world population of mankind has steadily been growing if you look at it globally. But there have been regions where during certain periods within this timespan this was not the case. For instance Ireland halfway the 19th century during the great famine. Could that event have had a positive effect on the human intelligence of Irish people? Another even more extreme example is the decline of the number of Jewish people in Europe during the first half of the 20th century. And what are the two richest ethnic groups, born in the USA? Yes, indeed, people that decent from those two ethnic groups. Just a coincidence? One should realize that these people survived those bad times, where more often threatened populations are bound to disappear or to be subdued. By the way if you look for the nations with the highest IQ you will end up in East Asia (Japan, Taiwan). If there were heavy times in those countries the last centuries I don’t know. Well, the recent history of Taiwan was quiet turbulent. The problem with IQ is that it says more about the level of education than of the real human intelligence.

If certain regions have a bigger than average chance to mutate, if these regions concern traits relevant to adapt to changing circumstances and if indeed an evolutionary trajectory of a genome is influenced by its evolutionary history, you can speak of a specific type of mutation that plays an essential role in the adaptation, survival and so evolution of a species. I call that a focused trait.

**A focused trait is a trait that has a determining effect on the evolution of a species, resulting in a gradually and steadily development in time of this trait towards a higher level, due to an (active or passive) inheritable susceptibility for mutations in the region(s) of the genome that determine(s) this trait. This inheritability means that offspring has a bigger than random chance to inherit this specific susceptibility. Both the favourable susceptibility and the inheribility could be an evolutionary result.**
