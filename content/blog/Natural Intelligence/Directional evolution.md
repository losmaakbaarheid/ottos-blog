# Directional Evolution

So how can evolution be guided without the need of the ‘hand of a god’? Until now we have seen intelligence as something that belongs to living creatures only. But Artificial Intelligence has shown us that this is not a condition. DNA looks much like a computer program and the last years computer programs have been developed with some kind of incorporated intelligence. So why should the DNA of humans and of other living creatures not also include some sort of intelligence? I have no clue why that should not be possible. You could say that it needs something super natural to add intelligence to DNA but then why does is not need that for programming a type of species? It is one or the other: or both parts of the DNA program were ‘written’ or no parts. And let us not forget that recent studies have shown us that indeed RNA, a molecule which looks to be as important for life as its ‘brother or sister’ DNA, shows some kind of intelligence: our cells contain a protein-directing machine, made of RNA and proteins, that sends newly made proteins to where they’re needed most in a cell. This machine is called the signal recognition particle (SRP) and so knows and decides where newly produced proteins will have the most benefits. Nothing random about it.

If you can imagine that a kind of ‘intelligence’ (intelligence not as ‘human intelligence’ but meaning \_circumstances in or influences acting on DNA/RNA leading to a clear direction in the evolution of a species\_\_\*) can be incorporated in the genome, many new possibilities come into view. That this ‘Artificial Intelligence’, or maybe \*\_‘Natural Intelligence’ (NI)\*\* is a better word, is a condition that is there all the time and so can do its job all the time or only at the moments it is triggered.

How could NI work? One could imagine that as a whole variations are random but on a species level or even on an individual level one variation is more likely to occur than another, for instance due to a lesser stability or a lesser protection against mutations of the concerning region or regions of their/its DNA/RNA. In fact recent research has revealed that mutations are not entirely random, so that in this respect the Evolution Theory is not accurate. For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’. This susceptibility could be there all the time or could be triggered by specific circumstances. The term ‘intelligence’ is even more to the point if this trigger is caused by a situation that needs a better fit in order to be evolutionary successful or even to survive.
