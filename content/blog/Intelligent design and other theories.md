# Intelligent Design And Other Theories

### AND OTHER THEORIES ERAF (APARTE PARAGRAAF)

The another well-known theory about the evolution of life is that it is designed by somebody or something (maybe a god). The overall term for these theories is ‘intelligent design’ (ID). NI agrees that it is unmistakable that in the evolution of life intelligence (in a bit other meaning) plays an important part. But that this intelligence does not include an intelligent somebody or something, but an intelligence incorporated in DNA and in the evolution of life itself. Let us see how the supporters of ID look at evolution, and the roll of intelligence and how NI stands in that. I have used ChatGTP in order to get the main themes of ID and the arguments in favour (core idea, example) and against (criticism). I added the viewpoint op NI+ExT to it.

_1. Irreducible Complexity_

- **Core Idea**: Irreducible complexity is the concept that some biological systems are composed of interdependent parts that all need to function together for the system to work. Removing any one part would make the entire system nonfunctional.
- **Example**: The bacterial flagellum, a cellular structure that functions like a motor, is often cited as an example. Proponents argue that it requires all of its parts to be present simultaneously to function, making it unlikely to have evolved step-by-step.
- **Criticism**: Opponents argue that complex systems can indeed evolve through a process known as "exaptation," where existing parts acquire new functions over time, gradually forming complex structures.
- **NI+ExT**: One mutation can activate one part of a biological system. This mutation can also effect other parts so they can start to function together (so called ‘package deal’). This is initiated by a focused trait that nullify obstructive traits and can make ‘useless’ traits useful, so one mutation can impact more parts in a system simultaneously. Exaptation is in my opinion not a possible explanation for this. And concerning the origine of main traits, like walking and flying, it is a very unlikely if not impossible phenomenon and so irrelevant.

_2. Specified Complexity_

- **Core Idea**: Specified complexity refers to patterns that are both complex (unlikely to occur by chance) and specified (following a recognizable pattern). ID advocates argue that certain biological structures contain a "blueprint" that is too precise and purposeful to have arisen randomly.
- **Example**: DNA, with its highly specific and complex sequences that code for life’s building blocks, is often presented as evidence of specified complexity.
- **Criticism**: Evolutionary biologists argue that natural selection is capable of producing highly specified complexity over time, as it "selects" traits beneficial for survival, creating complex, organized structures.
- **NI+ExT**: because the basics of traits are already present in DNA right from the start, complexity is way more easy to explain because you don’t have to start from scratch. Indeed the question remains how it is possible that these basics are present right from the start but that question is hardly more difficult to answer than the question how life could have started. And NI makes the question how over and over again new traits could appear during the evolution of life way easier to answer and more likely.

_3. Fine-Tuning Argument_

- **Core Idea**: The fine-tuning argument suggests that the universe’s physical constants (such as gravity, the cosmological constant, etc.) are set at values so precise that even a slight alteration would make life impossible. This precision suggests, according to ID, an intelligent designer who set these constants deliberately.
- **Example**: The cosmological constant, which governs the rate of expansion of the universe, is often cited because even minute changes would either prevent galaxies from forming or cause the universe to collapse.
- **Criticism**: Many physicists counter with the anthropic principle, which suggests that we observe these constants precisely because we exist in a universe that allows life. Multiverse theories also propose that many universes might exist with various constants, making our life-supporting universe just one among many.
- **NI+ExT**: doesn’t discuss this point because this is first and for all about the law of physics.
