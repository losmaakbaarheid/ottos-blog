# Intelligent Design And Other Theories

### AND OTHER THEORIES ERAF (APARTE PARAGRAAF)

The another well-known theory about the evolution of life is that it is designed by somebody or something (maybe a god). The overall term for these theories is ‘intelligent design’ (ID). NI agrees that it is unmistakable that in the evolution of life intelligence (in a bit other meaning) plays an important part. But that this intelligence does not include an intelligent somebody or something, but an intelligence incorporated in DNA and in the evolution of life itself. Let us see how the supporters of ID look at evolution, and the roll of intelligence and how NI stands in that. I have used ChatGTP in order to get the main themes of ID and the arguments in favour (core idea, example) and against (criticism). I added the viewpoint op NI+ExT to it.

1\. Irreducible Complexity

- **Core Idea**: Irreducible complexity is the concept that some biological systems are composed of interdependent parts that all need to function together for the system to work. Removing any one part would make the entire system nonfunctional.
- **Example**: The bacterial flagellum, a cellular structure that functions like a motor, is often cited as an example. Proponents argue that it requires all of its parts to be present simultaneously to function, making it unlikely to have evolved step-by-step.
- **Criticism**: Opponents argue that complex systems can indeed evolve through a process known as "exaptation," where existing parts acquire new functions over time, gradually forming complex structures.
- **NI+ExT**: One mutation can activate one part of a biological system. This mutation can also effect other parts so they can start to function together (so called ‘package deal’). This is initiated by a focused trait that nullify obstructive traits and can make ‘useless’ traits useful, so one mutation can impact more parts in a system simultaneously. Exaptation is in my opinion not a possible explanation for this. And concerning the origine of main traits, like walking and flying, it is a very unlikely if not impossible phenomenon and so irrelevant.
