# The Limitations Of The Evolution Theory page

Darwinism is based on coincidences, on random chances. There is a small chance that due to small DNA differences (genetic variation) an interaction can take place between or with little different seeds, eggs, sperm cells etc. – different from the ‘standard’ seeds, eggs, sperm cells - and that this results in an offspring that by coincidence is a little more adapted to specific circumstances and subsequently will have an advantage over the offspring produced by or with the ‘standard’ seeds (and so on) and so has the opportunity to become the new ‘standard’ (natural selection). Or with less words: Survival of the fittest (or maybe better: survival of the best fit) means that organisms that are better adapted to their environment, are best suited to survive and to successfully reproduce. So the evolution according to the Evolution Theory has no goal, no intelligence and is solely directed by the principle of ‘the survival of the fittest’.

This looks to a certain degree logic and quiet easy to understand. But not all the theories based on this principal, like men becoming more intelligent over and over again during their evolution, are for me easy to follow. It raises questions. I will explain why. Sometimes I get the feeling that the theory, that evolution is based on coincidences, is not only that popular because it describes the evolution of life and mankind in a clear way but because it makes it possible to get rid of a ‘creator’ in any form. In this respect it is an alternative to religion. Sometimes that seems to be the main, or at least a very important, reason why the Evolution Theory has become so huge and undisputable. Including the risk of becoming a believe and religion on its own: **coincidence is the new religion**.
