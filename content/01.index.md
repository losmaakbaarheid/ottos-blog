# **A Revolution in Evolution:**

## **No ‘intelligent design’, no ‘Darwinism’, but a complete new, revolutionary understanding of the evolution of life.**

Nor ‘intelligent design’ nor ‘Darwinism’ can give a complete and satisfying explanation of the evolution of life. Both need an (almost) religious believe in a ‘Creator’ or in ‘Coincidence’. In this blog I will present a third road without any such dogma’s, based on recent research and on logical thinking. Indeed a revolution in evolution.
