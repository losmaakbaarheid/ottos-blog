In fact recent research has revealed that mutations are not entirely random, so that in this respect the Evolution Theory is not accurate. For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’.

A shortage of food could be such an event or of some specific nutrients. Or, maybe even more likely, a longer period of anxiety. Obviously these situations are life threatening and can be caused by not fitting properly anymore due to developments in the outside world. The shortage of food causes a lack of certain nutrients in our body that could give a signal to the region in our DNA/RNA that can initiate a ‘sudden’ change in our DNA, and to be more specific the regions that define our human intelligence. Anxiety produces specific hormones that could do the same. What a cell becomes, is determined by what molecular machines—RNAs and proteins—are operating in that cell. And those RNAs and proteins that are present in a cell are determined by transcription factors that switch genes on and off. So indeed RNA and proteins can switch genes on and off and so can change a cell and these cells in their turn can define the species.

Why should such a situation appear over and over again during millions of years to keep the evolution going? And what is even more an enigma to me: consequently in the same direction! Let us for instance take a look at giraffes. They are well adapted with their long necks to reach the leaves higher up in the trees, higher than competitive animals are able to reach. That appears to be good enough. I have never heard about these necks becoming even longer and longer because they can’t reach the highest leaves. It is ok the way it is.

But we believe that before that time, this indeed happened based on a randomly occurring variation over a period of a couple of 100.000 to 1.000.000 years, during which Homo Heidelbergensis evolved into Homo Sapiens. But what the trigger was, that led to this development with a focus on a slowly but steadily increasing intelligence over such a long period is unclear to me. Did over and over again a bit more intelligence make the better fit? Why? How? This step-by-step growing intelligence should have happened many times but still random. This seems unlikely, even more if you realize that almost all mutations of DNA are neutral or negative in their effect. Positive mutations are very rare! We do not see this process happening in our days and well you can imagine that other human traits - like looks, strength, dominancy, drive and cunningness - were at least equally as important during those days.

Did Einstein and Oppenheimer produce more offspring than average, say Hulk Hogan? No! So in the past and (even) in our days intelligence is not considered by our instincts to be the trait to have the better or even the best fit.

And this could indeed be qualified as a trigger for evolution that was there constantly for a longer period of time. So getting lighter and lighter over a period of many thousands of years in many small steps can be considered as un understandable evolutionary process, in the combination with the fact that the migration of mankind from the tropics to colder regions also was a process over a longer period of time. By the way mixing with Neanderthals could maybe also explain this change. This gradually process of losing pigment is not much different from the finches on the Galapagos Islands with their specific beaks. But then again: what was the continuous trigger for a likewise process regarding human intelligence?

It is no coincidence that leaders often are more ruthless than the average people. And that has always been so. Alexander the Great, Julius Ceasar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon.
