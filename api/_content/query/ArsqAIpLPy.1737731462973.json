Besides that I presented a quiet huge number of examples, motivations and articles based on research that contradicts that only beneficial mutations could give these result. The right answer? I don’t know. Obviously DNA was coded right from the start to bring life. How? Maybe there is something like a ‘law of life’ like there is a ‘law of gravity’ and is life one of the basis forces. Possibly our knowledge will grow so much in the future that some explanation will become obvious without the need of ‘coincidences’ and without the need of a ‘creator’."}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"5.
