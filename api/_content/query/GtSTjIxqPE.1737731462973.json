The overall term for these theories is ‘intelligent design’ (ID). NI agrees that it is unmistakable that in the evolution of life intelligence (in a bit other meaning) plays an important part. But that this intelligence does not include an intelligent somebody or something, but an intelligence incorporated in DNA and in the evolution of life itself. Let us see how the supporters of ID look at evolution, and the roll of intelligence and how NI stands in that. I have used ChatGTP in order to get the main themes of ID and the arguments in favour (core idea, example) and against (criticism). I added the viewpoint op NI+ExT to it.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:03.blog:06.Intelligent design and other theories.md:01.intelligent design.md","_source":"content","_file":"03.blog/06.Intelligent design and other theories.md/01.intelligent design.md","_stem":"03.blog/06.Intelligent design and other theories.md/01.intelligent design","_extension":"md"}]
