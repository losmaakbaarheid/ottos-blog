There is a small chance that due to small DNA differences (genetic variation) an interaction can take place between or with little different seeds, eggs, sperm cells etc. – different from the ‘standard’ seeds, eggs, sperm cells - and that this results in an offspring that by coincidence is a little more adapted to specific circumstances and subsequently will have an advantage over the offspring produced by or with the ‘standard’ seeds (and so on) and so has the opportunity to become the new ‘standard’ (natural selection). Or with less words: Survival of the fittest (or maybe better: survival of the best fit) means that organisms, that are better adapted to their environment, are best suited to survive and to successfully reproduce. So the evolution according to the Evolution Theory has no goal, no intelligence and is solely directed by the principle of ‘the survival of the fittest’.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:03.blog:01.The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory.md","_source":"content","_file":"03.blog/01.The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory.md","_stem":"03.blog/01.The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory","_extension":"md"}]
