Are there any evidences, formulae, can it be reproduced or repeated? Yes it is science, but not science like for instance the Relativity Theory. Still, putting question marks behind the Evolution Theory, or just parts of it, is a bit tricky. If you have the courage to do so, the reaction is almost always: ok so you believe in a god! The thought that there could be more ways beside these two, to explain life and the evolution of life, seems to be a taboo. Still, doubts and questions are the road to new theories and new discoveries. So I want to pick up this challenge. I am not religious and I am not an expert concerning the Evolution Theory. On the one hand that could be a disadvantage and has the risk of sometimes missing the point and using wrong terms but on the other hand I don’t have to carry the burden of learned dogma’s or of any angry reactions of colleagues. I know it is much easier to break down another one’s theory than to make and defend your own. Therefor I will start to put question marks behind the scope of the Evolution Theory, as we know it today, but only with the purpose to explain the basics behind an essential addition to this theory, I would like to present and describe to you.  ","navigation":{"title":"Blog"},"layout":"full-width","head":{"description":"This is a custom description for Content Wind about page."},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:blog:index.md","_source":"content","_file":"blog/index.md","_stem":"blog/index","_extension":"md"}]
