The Evolution Theory of today does, but NI+ExT not. Why not? Simply because I can’t think about any possible process that could bring dead materials alive. It is way easier to go from something to everything than to go from nothing to something.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:03.blog:05.Origin of species.md","_source":"content","_file":"03.blog/05.Origin of species.md","_stem":"03.blog/05.Origin of species","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/blog/intelligent-design-and-other-theories.md/other-theories","_dir":"intelligent-design-and-other-theories.md","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Other Theories","description":"Orthogenesis, also known as orthogenetic evolution, progressive evolution, evolutionary progress, or progressionism, is an obsolete biological hypothesis that organisms have an innate tendency to evolve in a definite direction due to some internal mechanism or \"driving force\". According to this theory, the largest-scale trends in evolution have an absolute goal such as increasing biological complexity. In most modern statements of the theory, the idea of continuous and progressive change in one or more characters, due according to some to internal factors, according to others to external causes. Evolution in a \"straight line\" seems to be the central idea. Orthogenesis assumes that variation is not random but is directed towards fixed goals.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:03.blog:06.Intelligent design and other theories.md:02.Other theories.md","_source":"content","_file":"03.blog/06.Intelligent design and other theories.md/02.Other theories.md","_stem":"03.blog/06.Intelligent design and other theories.md/02.Other theories","_extension":"md"}]
