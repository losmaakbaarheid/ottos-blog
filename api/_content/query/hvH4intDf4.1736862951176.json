Are there any evidences, formulae, can it be reproduced or repeated? Yes it is science, but not science like for instance the Relativity Theory. Still, putting question marks behind the Evolution Theory, or just parts of it, is a bit tricky. If you have the courage to do so, the reaction is almost always: ok so you believe in a god! The thought that there could be more ways beside these two, to explain life and the evolution of life, seems to be a taboo. Still, doubts and questions are the road to new theories and new discoveries. So I want to pick up this challenge. I am not religious and I am not an expert concerning the Evolution Theory. On the one hand that could be a disadvantage and has the risk of sometimes missing the point and using wrong terms but on the other hand I don’t have to carry the burden of learned dogma’s or of any angry reactions of colleagues. I know it is much easier to break down another one’s theory than to make and defend your own. Therefor I will start to put question marks behind the scope of the Evolution Theory, as we know it today, but only with the purpose to explain the basics behind an essential addition to this theory, I would like to present and describe to you.  ","navigation":{"title":"Intro"},"layout":"full-width","head":{"description":"This is a custom description for Content Wind about page."},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:02.intro.md","_source":"content","_file":"02.intro.md","_stem":"02.intro","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/blog/the-limitations-of-the-evolution-theory","_dir":"blog","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"The Limitations Of The Evolution Theory page","description":"Darwinism is based on coincidences, on random chances. There is a small chance that due to small DNA differences (genetic variation) an interaction can take place between or with little different seeds, eggs, sperm cells etc. – different from the ‘standard’ seeds, eggs, sperm cells - and that this results in an offspring that by coincidence is a little more adapted to specific circumstances and subsequently will have an advantage over the offspring produced by or with the ‘standard’ seeds (and so on) and so has the opportunity to become the new ‘standard’ (natural selection). Or with less words: Survival of the fittest (or maybe better: survival of the best fit) means that organisms, that are better adapted to their environment, are best suited to survive and to successfully reproduce. So the evolution according to the Evolution Theory has no goal, no intelligence and is solely directed by the principle of ‘the survival of the fittest’.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:03.blog:01.The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory.md","_source":"content","_file":"03.blog/01.The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory.md","_stem":"03.blog/01.The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory","_extension":"md"}]
