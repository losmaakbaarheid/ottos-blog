Every new species grows in time very slowly away from his or her ancestor, leaving a long trail of transition forms or even of ‘missing links’. The differences between ancestors and new species are quiet small and both have traits that are (especially om the beginning) closely related; not clearly different traits that would excel in the same or different biospheres. There are many transition forms needed with each time a bit adjusted traits, that characterizes each of these forms, before a significant distance is realized compared to species 1, with which it all begins.

An extremely time consuming process."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When you compare this with a schematic picture of NI (especially with evolutionary revolution) you get a very different result: see the picture below. Each branch shows a new or principally changed focused trait. To illustrate this every angle is made 90 degrees. So the angle is way bigger and can go in any direction. The result is a 3D beam structure with beams (species) going in every possible direction. These perpendicular angels are possible due to the fact that the DNA regions that determines the new trait are basically already there and therefor just have to be switched on by coincidence or by a trigger. The consequence of this different way of branching is easy to see this way: the evolution of species according to NI does not only goes much faster but is more principal and also leads to a way better filling of the biosphere by a huge amount of species that are less competing with each other and that are far more complementing each other."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"So what to make out of this? My theory is that the ‘NI-tree’ resembles the first step of the evolution of life or of a principle new type/family of species and the ‘ET-tree’ resembles the following phases of developing new species within one family. So most branches in the NI-tree end eventually in a branch of the ET-type. This combination will give by the far best filling of all biospheres.

So again an indication that NI combined with ET gives a better description of the evolution of life than the Evolution Theory on its own. Earlier I showed my surprise that, if you read about the evolution of cheetahs, you will find stories about fossils of its ancestors concerning the evolution of theirs sculls but not about the evolution of their physical development influencing their running speed. Now that becomes easier to understand. Running speed is a focused trait so less transition forms and brain volume is not a focused trait concerning cheetahs so more transition forms. "}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are clear examples of a sudden appearance of a new family of species during the history of evolution.
