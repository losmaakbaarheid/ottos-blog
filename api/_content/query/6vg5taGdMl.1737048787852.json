At least in my opinion. I already mentioned the transition from quadrupedalism to bipedalism as a result of many mutations, where each individual mutation on its own would have offered zero better fit, if not a worse fit. Meaning that this process would have stopped as soon as it began if ‘survival of the fittest’ was the only engine of evolution.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:03.blog:03.The Excitatus Theory:02.Why are fossils of transition forms rare.md","_source":"content","_file":"03.blog/03.The Excitatus Theory/02.Why are fossils of transition forms rare.md","_stem":"03.blog/03.The Excitatus Theory/02.Why are fossils of transition forms rare","_extension":"md"}]
