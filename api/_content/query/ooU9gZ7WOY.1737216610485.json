Apes and men still survive in the same conditions. Why should a process going in an certain direction and so having an inevitable (end)result, need a ‘strategically planned manner’? Some boundaries and some basic principles are good enough. Gravity is based on a law of nature, electromagnetism is based on a law of nature and also the forces within atoms.

So the inevitable result of evolution could be an as big as possible and an as variable as possible population of species. To reach this, all these different species will have to fit in and fill in every niche that our world offers. That asks for specialisation or even for super specialisation.

This means complexity, see for instance all the mentioned traits you need to become the best and fastest tree climber or to walk upright.

So the inevitable outcome of evolution according to NI are as numerous as possible and as diverse as possible life forms, varying from one cell creatures to very complex creatures fitting is every niche, even the tinny ones, that by the way makes these life forms more and more vulnerable for even small changes.

And that is the second law of thermodynamics. This supposed contradiction is also known as the Schrödinger paradox. This law states that the total entropy (degree of chaos) in a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process, if it is a closed system; it will never decrease. Say you throw a bottle made out of glass on the floor. The result will never by something that makes any sense, but there are billions of possible random divisions of the chippings. The entropy (the chaos) in a system can only decrease if energy is put into it from outside, resulting is a less chaotic situation. If you talk about the bottle, that means gluing it together again. A living creature is less chaotic than the materials needed to make this creature. To make a living creature, these materials have to be organized and combined in a very special and even unique way, which results in a very strong reduction of entropy. Energy and effort have to be brought in to make a living creature from materials. Energy can be derived from the sun and other sources. But where does this needed effort come from? The Evolution Theory points in this respect to ‘coincidences’ but this second law defines that coincidences will lead to a bigger chaos, a higher state of entropy.

That could lead to a clear split, or maybe a bigger split than there already is, in society. This sounds like a negative development, but it could become even worse. If (technical) intelligence means money and sex appeal, it also means the attraction of beauty. So that could lead to an also visual split: good looking, intelligent people could become a class apart. And we can go on. The men and women at the top of the technical pyramid will have, and already to a certain degree have, the capabilities and means of widening the gap between them and the less ‘lucky ones’.

Or change the DNA/RNA-region that determines the human intelligence directly. But will that change be inherited and will that not give all kinds of unknown and potentially dangerous side effects? If there is indeed something like a Natural Intelligence in a region of our DNA, and the focus of this is human intelligence, sooner or later we will find and may even decode this DNA-region and their interactions with proteins and so on. That would give much more insight. And if we can find out how this region can produce a variation that implicates steps towards a higher IQ, we could force a spurt within our own evolution. We could maybe become able to manipulate our Natural Intelligence in the same way nature does it and so boost it in our offspring. This change will be ‘natural’ and will, if made inheritable, be part of the human DNA from there on in the concerning persons.

Maybe these kind of DNA-adaptations are even necessary to be able to make long journeys into space possible. Probably our knowledge of DNA and high tech will grow so much the coming years, that at a certain moment in the future we will be able to do so, by manipulating the DNA in order to trigger or even create new traits, which basics may or may not already be present in our DNA. And adding high tech implants and robots could also be an option. Maybe only looking for earth look-a-likes in space is therefore too narrow.

The differences between ancestors and new species are quiet small and both have traits that are (especially om the beginning) closely related; not clearly different traits that would excel in the same or different biospheres. There are many transition forms needed with each time a bit adjusted traits, that characterizes each of these forms, before a significant distance is realized compared to species 1, with which it all begins.

The result is a 3D beam structure with beams (species) going in every possible direction.

The consequence of this different way of branching is easy to see this way: the evolution of species according to NI does not only goes much faster but is more principal and also leads to a way better filling of the biosphere by a huge amount of species that are less competing with each other and that are far more complementing each other."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"So what to make out of this?
