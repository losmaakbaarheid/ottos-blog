In this respect it is an alternative to religion. Sometimes that seems to be the main, or at least a very important, reason why the Evolution Theory has become so huge and undisputable.

If you are well adapted to specific circumstances than you are well adapted: “the survival of the good enough”. Than why is there the need or a reward to adapt even more? Only if the adaptation at any moment in time is not good enough anymore or could give a significantly better exixtance, yes there would be a reason. Why should such a situation appear over and over again during millions of years to keep the evolution going? Let us for instance take a look at giraffes. They are well adapted with their long necks to reach the leaves higher up in the trees, higher than competitive animals are able to reach. That appears to be good enough. I have never heard about these necks becoming even longer and longer because they can’t reach the highest leaves. It is ok the way it is. One giraffe with the longest neck of all apparently does not present the best fit an so dictates the future evolution of giraffes."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"extreem long neck.jpeg","src":"/extreem%20long%20neck.jpeg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let us also look at human beings. Are we more intelligent than the ancient Romans or Greeks? Than say Julius Ceasar or Plato? I have read some of their stories and I can assure you that it is an illusion to think that we are more intelligent. So obviously, they fitted well enough and so over the last 2000 years or so no evolution of our intelligence has taken place. But we believe that before that time, this indeed happened based on a randomly occurring variation over a period of a couple of 100.000 to 1.000.000 years, during which Homo Heidelbergensis evolved into Homo Sapiens. But what the trigger was, that led to this development with a focus on a slowly but steadily increasing intelligence over such a long period is unclear to me. Did over and over again a bit more intelligence make the better fit? Why? How? This step-by-step growing intelligence should have happened many times but still random. This seems unlikely, even more if you realize that almost all mutations of DNA are neutral or negative in their effect. Positive mutations are very rare! We do not see this process happening in our days and well you can imagine that other human traits - like looks, strength, dominancy, drive and cunningness - were at least equally as important during those days. A further striking recent conclusion is that the Neanderthals were as intelligent as Homo Sapiens."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"einstein with kids.jpeg","src":"/einstein%20with%20kids.jpeg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And nowadays, when indeed intelligence makes a difference, we don’t see a clear evolutionary process in the direction of a growing intelligence. Women are still more attracted to men with a six pack than to geeks, although intelligence is considered to be the one unique trait that made men over a period of many of thousands of years the high end of the evolution. Did Einstein and Oppenheimer produce more offspring than average, say Hulk Hogan? No! So in the past and (even) in our days intelligence is not considered by our instincts to be the trait to have the better or even the best fit.
