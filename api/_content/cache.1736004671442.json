In fact recent research has revealed that mutations are not entirely random, so that in this respect the Evolution Theory is not accurate. For every species and even for every individual his or her DNA is (slightly) different. So you can image that offspring can inherit that specific sensitivity for these not random and more likely variations. Say that for some kind of fish the speed of swimming offers a favourable fit. And one individual fish has a small variation leading to a bit faster swimming. According to the here presented theory this is not a 100% random happening because this fish is a bit more susceptible for DNA/RNA-variations in the region that determines the swimming speed than for other variations. Because it is the better fit, this fish will produce extra offspring and some of this offspring will also inherit this instability or less protection, leading to this susceptibility. This can result in a lasting focus on faster swimming and so would lead to an evolutionary direction not purely dictated by coincidences and ‘survival of the fittest’.

A shortage of food could be such an event or of some specific nutrients. Or, maybe even more likely, a longer period of anxiety. Obviously these situations are life threatening and can be caused by not fitting properly anymore due to developments in the outside world. The shortage of food causes a lack of certain nutrients in our body that could give a signal to the region in our DNA/RNA that can initiate a ‘sudden’ change in our DNA, and to be more specific the regions that define our human intelligence. Anxiety produces specific hormones that could do the same. What a cell becomes, is determined by what molecular machines—RNAs and proteins—are operating in that cell. And those RNAs and proteins that are present in a cell are determined by transcription factors that switch genes on and off. So indeed RNA and proteins can switch genes on and off and so can change a cell and these cells in their turn can define the species.

Evolutionary processes according to the Evolution Theory will be able to create new species but (in my opinion) limited to the same family of plants or animals. Geographical circumstances (isolation) to accomplish that are an important if not essential condition. Evolution is limited to the non-focused traits. You may wonder what the function of evolution can be if directional evolution is much quicker and more effective. But the point is that this is limited to the focused trait(s). The non-directional evolution is more flexible. If for instance bacteria become immune against a certain poison, this is probably thanks to this randomness and its flexibility: a few of these bacteria will by coincidence have a mutation that make them resistant.

This directional evolution is still a quiet slow process but faster than the processes according to the Evolution Theory because a bigger part of the variations in time are in the same direction so will enhance each other. Examples are the steadily growing intelligence of mankind since his/her origin and the growing climbing capacities of apes. Geographical circumstances are usually not essential. Therefor the group, that does not undergo this ‘programmed’ changes or in a slower tempo, has the risk to become extinct. This is what possibly happened to Neanderthals.

This ‘sudden’ change of susceptibility can be a reaction to exterior or interior circumstances (actively, because these circumstances activate certain processes in the bodies of the species) or can be initiated by a coincidental other type of mutation that offers a new inheritable susceptibility for genetic variations that could (in time) give a better fit or another fit (passively) than the existing inheritable susceptibility. A new species (in time), possibly even no longer belonging to the same family of plants or animals, can be the result of this. Existence next to a group of species that did not undergo these changes, is possible or even likely, because the difference in focus becomes so big, that in time there is no decisive competition on an equal level for territory and/or food. So if these processes lead to another fit, existence next to each other is plausible. If the revolution is activated by external circumstances, revolutionary evolution could be the only process that makes it possible for the concerning species to survive in a fast and/or significantly changing environment.

Random mutations are of course there but a bit surprisingly also directional changes. Stasis is frequently associated with the theory of punctuated equilibrium, in which most evolutionary changes are concentrated during the (phylogenetic) branching of lineages in very rapid bursts of speciation. Much longer episodes of relative morphological invariance, or stasis, follow the speciation events. Doesn’t that sound a little bit like revolutionary evolution and even like active susceptibility? Is my NI-theory really that new? In a recent article by Hunt this scientist writes that he has found that directional change during the evolution of a lineage is relatively small (occurring only in 5% of 250 analysed traits). Of those traits that were shown to follow a trend, size was more likely to show gradual changes, whereas shape changes were more random.

This law states that the total entropy (degree of chaos) in a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process, if it is a closed system; it will never decrease. Say you throw a bottle made out of glass on the floor. The result will never by something that makes any sense, but there are billions of possible random divisions of the chippings. The entropy (the chaos) in a system can only decrease if energy is put into it from outside, resulting is a less chaotic situation. If you talk about the bottle, that means gluing it together again. A living creature is less chaotic than the materials needed to make this creature. To make a living creature, these materials have to be organized and combined in a very special and even unique way, which results in a very strong reduction of entropy. Energy and effort have to be brought in to make a living creature from materials. Energy can be derived from the sun and other sources. But where does this needed effort come from? The Evolution Theory points in this respect to ‘coincidences’ but this second law defines that coincidences will lead to a bigger chaos, a higher state of entropy.
