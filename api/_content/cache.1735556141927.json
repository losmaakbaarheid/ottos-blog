Why should such a situation appear over and over again during millions of years to keep the evolution going? And what is even more an enigma to me: consequently in the same direction! Let us for instance take a look at giraffes. They are well adapted with their long necks to reach the leaves higher up in the trees, higher than competitive animals are able to reach. That appears to be good enough. I have never heard about these necks becoming even longer and longer because they can’t reach the highest leaves. It is ok the way it is.

So obviously, they fitted well enough and so over the last 2000 years or so no evolution of our intelligence has taken place. But we believe that before that time, this indeed happened based on a randomly occurring variation over a period of a couple of 100.000 to 1.000.000 years, during which Homo Heidelbergensis evolved into Homo Sapiens. But what the trigger was, that led to this development with a focus on a slowly but steadily increasing intelligence over such a long period is unclear to me. Did over and over again a bit more intelligence make the better fit? Why? How? This step-by-step growing intelligence should have happened many times but still random. This seems unlikely, even more if you realize that almost all mutations of DNA are neutral or negative in their effect. Positive mutations are very rare! We do not see this process happening in our days and well you can imagine that other human traits - like looks, strength, dominancy, drive and cunningness - were at least equally as important during those days.

Did Einstein and Oppenheimer produce more offspring than average, say Hulk Hogan? No! So in the past and (even) in our days intelligence is not considered by our instincts to be the trait to have the better or even the best fit.

And this could indeed be qualified as a trigger for evolution that was there constantly for a longer period of time. So getting lighter and lighter over a period of many thousands of years in many small steps can be considered as un understandable evolutionary process, in the combination with the fact that the migration of mankind from the tropics to colder regions also was a process over a longer period of time. By the way mixing with Neanderthals could maybe also explain this change. This gradually process of losing pigment is not much different from the finches on the Galapagos Islands with their specific beaks. But then again: what was the continuous trigger for a likewise process regarding human intelligence?

It is no coincidence that leaders often are more ruthless than the average people. And that has always been so. Alexander the Great, Julius Ceasar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon.

Please read it with an open mind! What does that mean with regard to this specific subject? That ‘coincidence’ (yes there is this word again) doesn’t exclude by definition a creator (why shouldn’t coincidences be a tool of this creator to make evolution less predictable?) and that a ‘non-coincidence’ (everything that happens more often or less then random) include by definition a creator (for instance if you bounce a ball with the same force the distance that it bounces back is not random. Nobody sees that as an act of god)."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"coincidence creator.png","src":"/coincidence%20creator.png","style":"height: 50px; margin: 0 auto;"},"children":[]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:blog:The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory.md","_source":"content","_file":"blog/The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory.md","_stem":"blog/The-limitations-of-the-Evolution-Theory","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/comments","_dir":"","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Comments page","description":"","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"comments-page"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Comments page"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:Comments.md","_source":"content","_file":"Comments.md","_stem":"Comments","_extension":"md"}],"navigation":[{"title":"Home","_path":"/"},{"title":"About","_path":"/about","layout":"full-width"},{"title":"Intro","_path":"/blog","children":[{"title":"Intro","_path":"/blog"},{"title":"Intelligent Design And Other Theories page","_path":"/blog/intelligent-design-and-other-theories"},{"title":"Natural Intelligence","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence","children":[{"title":"Natural Intelligence","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence"},{"title":"Directional Evolution","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence/directional-evolution"},{"title":"Evolution Seen In A Bigger Picture page","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence/evolution-seen-in-a-bigger-picture"},{"title":"Implications Of NI page","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence/implications-of-ni"},{"title":"O Revolutionary Evolution page","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence/revolutionary-evolution"},{"title":"Summary Of NI page","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence/summary-of-ni"},{"title":"The Future Of Evolution page","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence/the-future-of-evolution"},{"title":"The Goals Of Evolution page","_path":"/blog/natural-intelligence/the-goals-of-evolution"}]},{"title":"Origin Of Species page","_path":"/blog/origin-of-species"},{"title":"Remarks page","_path":"/blog/remarks"},{"title":"Summary page","_path":"/blog/summary"},{"title":"The Limitations Of The Evolution Theory page","_path":"/blog/the-limitations-of-the-evolution-theory"}]},{"title":"Comments page","_path":"/comments"}]}
